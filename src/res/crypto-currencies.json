    "name": "Cardano",
    "description": "Launched in 2017, Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project which is fully open source and was built to support the creation of decentralized financial applications (dApps). It claims to have more advanced features than any protocol developed and to have the first currency to evolve out of scientific philosophy, academic theory, and peer-reviewed research. Appropriately, the platform takes its name from Gerolamo Cardano, an Italian polymath who is regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the Renaissance. \n\n The native cryptocurrency of Cardano is called Ada (ADA), named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician (and daughter of Lord Byron) who is often referred to as the first computer programmer. The currency is integrated natively into Cardano\u2019s settlement layer, making it an essential part of the platform; however, this is something that Cardano reportedly intends to supersede. \n\n Ada enables users to send value over the internet securely and quickly. After launch, Ada had one official wallet called Daedalus. The circulating supply of Ada was 25 billion in 2018, with a maximum potential supply of 45 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Ada offers the ability to stake coins (essentially earn interest on holdings); however, due to the limited number of coins, the block reward is expected to drop over time. \n\n Cardano is spearheaded by three entities, each of which is separately owned and managed. The first is the non-profit Cardano Foundation, an independent body based in Switzerland with core responsibilities to help supervise the development of Cardano and its ecosystem. The second entity is Input Output HK (IOHK) which is contracted to design and build Cardano. The third is Emurgo, a Japanese incubator acting as the for-profit arm working to boost the Cardano ecosystem through commercial ventures. \n\n Rather than stemming from a whitepaper, Cardano is the result of a number of academic papers. The goal being that considerable peer review efforts via academic partnerships will ensure that Cardano is built and operated using qualitative \u2018high assurance code.\u2019 Cardano is being developed using Haskell, a programming language unique to the platform, featuring a high degree of fault tolerance. Smart contracts are created in another functional language called Plutus which enables stricter contracts. \n\n Like Ethereum, Cardano is a smart contract platform. It features a unique consensus algorithm (called Ouroboros) that validates transactions without high energy costs, aiming to dramatically increase transactions per second while boosting computational power. The platform is considered \u2018third-generation\u2019 and is intended to improve on second-generation platforms like Ethereum and first-generation platforms like Bitcoin. This is partly achieved by employing the \u2018Ouroboros proof-of-stake\u2019 model rather than a proof-of-work model. \n\n Both Ethereum and Cardano (or IOHK, the entity that designs and builds Cardano) were co-founded by Charles Hoskinson. Charles is a Colorado-based technology entrepreneur and mathematician who also founded a third cryptocurrency-related start-up \u2013 Invictus Innovations. \n\n IOHK\u2019s second founder, Jeremy Wood, was formerly Manager of Operations at Ethereum, which he left to consult various entities on cryptocurrencies before co-founding Input Output. \n\n A key focus of Cardano is to use its coin and technology to provide assistance in countries with an acute lack of access to banking. Cardano has explicitly stated that its currency\u2019s ultimate value will be based upon hard work, real-world use, and the utility of the platform, not on making day traders rich.",

    "description": "Aeternity is \u0430n open-source blockchain-based platform designed for creating decentralized apps (dApps).  It focuses on creating a highly scalable solution with smart contracts that are able to interact with real-world and real-time data via built-in oracles.  It is fueled by a native utility token AE which can be used as a means of payment within the platform itself.\n\n\nAeternity technical features\n\n\nThe platform was launched in 2016 long before the \u201cbull-run\u201d of 2017 which revealed the issues of Bitcoin and Ethereum related to their small throughput indices.  However, the founders of Aeternity foresaw that issue and have invented a scalable solution coming with the following technical characteristics:\n\nState channels.  In order to overcome the scalability issue, Aeternity implements state channels to execute transactions and smart contracts off-chain.  This helps to move the load away from the blockchain and allows executing millions of micro-transactions in a given moment in time.\nBased on Erlang.  Aeternity relies on the programming language Erlang that has been used in the area of telecommunications for more than 3 decades and proved its efficiency.\nA new language for smart contracts.  The Sophia language is based on OCaml and is similar to the Reason language which can be regarded as an advantage as it simplifies the development process.\nThe combination of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).  The consensus model utilized by Aeternity uses an ASIC-resistant and power-efficient PoW mechanism named Cuckoo Cycle helping it produce new blocks every 15 seconds.  The PoS approach enables governance as every AE holder can vote on system improvements.\nOracles.  These are used to request real-world data from different providers and embed them into the blockchain.\nIntegrated naming system.  This feature allows Aeternity users to create named accounts to store their funds instead of unreadable wallet addresses that are utilized by Bitcoin and Ether users.\n\n\nAeternity use cases\n\n\nThe platform enables numerous use cases with only a few of them listed below.\n\nDistributed aepps ecosystem.  Aeternity has its own name for dApps as it calls them \u201caepps\u201d.  The platform has a whole set of out-of-the-box solutions including SDKs and APIs that help to bootstrap the development of aepps.  \nCrowdfunding projects.  Aeternity has developed smart contracts helping projects raise money and at the same time protect contributors against failure.  These smart contracts imply giving a refund in case a project is unsuccessful and only release the funds after the product has been delivered.\nInstant video game rewards.  Aeternity enhances the gaming industry with the help of the blockchain technologies providing users with full control over their in-game transactions and reducing intermediaries.\nDecentralized fintech.  The platform gives the possibility to unlock payments for any contracts upon completion of one or more events helping to reduce redundant third-parties.\nTrust-free exchanges.  Users can make cross-chain trust-free atomic swaps between different blockchain-based assets.\nMicro and nano payments.  As Aeternity allows taking transactions off-chain, it removes all the obstacles preventing Bitcoin from being used on a daily basis for small transactions.  Payments are conducted instantly at near-to-zero fees helping users maintain their privacy.\n\n\nAE token\n\n\nThe Aeternity platform embeds its native utility token AE to fuel its economy and ecosystem.  The token can be earned as a reward via mining as well as used for payments within the platform for smart contracts\u2019 execution.  AE holders can participate in platform governance and vote for any new features and suggestions offered by other participants.\n\nInitially based on Ethereum\u2019s ERC20 standard, the tokens were swapped to Aeternity\u2019s native system after the mainnet was launched on November 27th, 2018.\n\nThe ICO was launched on May 29th and lasted until June 19th, 2017.  The team has managed to raise close to 25 million USD in Ether for the future development of their product.  82% of tokens were distributed via the public sale, 1% was given away via Airdrop to BTC and ETH holders and the remaining 17% stayed in the foundation reserve.\n\n\nThe Aeternity team\n\n\nAlthough the company is registered in Liechtenstein, most of its team members are located in Bulgaria.  \n\nThe CEO and Founder of the project is Yanislav Malahov who names himself as the godfather of Ethereum as he collaborated with Vitalik Buterin back in 2013.  He has extensive experience in development as he started his career building a stock prediction game on top of Twitter in 2010 and also developed the first Dogecoin browser wallet in 2014.\n\nAll-in-all, the team standing behind Aeternity is really big as at the time of writing it covers almost 80 different specialists.  \n",

    "description": "Aion is a multi-tier open-source blockchain infrastructure of the Open Application Network (the OAN), designed for the creation and hosting of Open Apps.  These apps are designed to help users regain control over all aspects of their data, including privacy, digital assets, and ownership rights.  Open Apps are universally accessible across the blockchain platforms, thus making Aion enterprise a centric network enabling the interconnection of permissioned blockchain systems.  The founder of the platform Matt Spoke perceives the Open Applications as a new category of digital assets representing the future of the blockchain.\n\nThe AION coin is a utility token designed for the smooth work of the 3rd generation blockchain platforms helping to resolve the problem of interoperability.  Aion creates an ecosystem helping different blockchains to communicate with each other.  The project was launched by Nuco, a Toronto-based IT startup in 2017.\n\nWhat problems Aion aims to resolve\n\nAion aims to support future blockchain platforms and solve some critical problems which the blockchain industry faces nowadays.  One of the key problems that Aion targets to resolve is blockchain interoperability as numerous blockchain projects operate within their own universes and have no means to communicate with each other.  Aion joined Blockchain Interoperability Alliance backed by ICON and Wanchain, the main goal of which is the promotion of interconnectivity between the isolated blockchain networks.\n\nThe mission of Aion is to become the common protocol for the blockchains enabling dApps to be adopted at scale.  Different blockchains need a hub for connecting with each other, and Aion plans to become one.  With the help of this platform, it\u2019s possible to transfer data across numerous blockchains making different platforms interoperable.  \n\nAion aims to become a glue connecting different blockchains and keeping them together despite the fact that they are built securely on different architectures.  The problem is very acute for the blockchain industry.  Being envisioned as something to replace banks, blockchain-based projects haven\u2019t achieved the goal yet because instead of consolidating their efforts, they have created numerous isolated blockchains with cryptocurrencies that are not connected and cannot be freely exchanged between each other.  There is no technical infrastructure for this connection to provide communications and transfers across the networks.  Aion came up with a technical solution and offers the infrastructure of this type.\n\nThe Aion platform and technology\n\nWith Aion, the open application architecture provides an alternative business model that is applied to decentralized platforms.  Blockchains give the opportunity for the decoupling of data from services leveraging that data, offering more control and privacy to its owners, and delivering a wider spectrum of services to be built.\n\nThe Aion network uses a combined Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Delegated Proof of Stake algorithm, which was connected with a neural network-powered Proof of Intelligence to ensure consensus.  The networks resemble a local network serving as a mediator between different blockchains to bring them all to a certain standard for the exchange of values and the creation of a chain of transactions.\n\nThe AION is a utility token of the platform that fuels network transactions.  AION is mined using a modified Equihash Proof-of-Work mining algorithm.  Initially, the algorithm was called ASIC-resistant, but the mining gear has developed since then.  The Everest version of Aion launched a DPoS-PoI hybrid consensus mechanism employing Validators and Backers.  If Backers stake the computing power or AION, the validators distribute rewards when a block is validated.  This scheme of action was developed for balancing financial and computing power.\n\nThe Aion network uses bridges (communication protocols) for interchain transactions.  The individual consensus is required on each bridge employing a certain consensus mechanism from the main chain.  Validator nodes earn mining and transaction rewards as they validate these transactions, which afterward are distributed among node backers.  Intertain transactions are created on a source blockchain and then after processing and forwarding by bridges and connecting networks, they reach the required destination, i.e. the targeted blockchain.  The routing of an interchain transaction is a multi-phase process, during which the transaction is verified by validators and consensus is reached.  The platform offers a bounty program rewarding its users for technical support and any type of assistance.\n\nAION tokens\n\nIn October 2017, the blockchain company Nuco announced that Aion has raised 22 million US dollars\u2019 worth of ETH during the ICO token sale for the building of the first interoperable blockchain network.  At that period, AION was an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.  The Aion blockchain mainnet called Kilimanjaro was launched later, in April 2018.\n\nThe AION token swap from ERC-20 to native AION blockchain came to an end by December 2018.  More than 97% of the tokens had been swapped by then.  Those who missed the swap can submit a request on support service to get their tokens swapped.  The company used its own technology to transfer tokens, so the Token Swap employed a Token Transfer bridge demonstrating the potential of its system.\n\nAION is traded on such platforms as DragonEX, Binance, BCEx, and a few others.  The cryptocurrency can be stored in the official AION wallets with versions for different operating systems.  Also, Trust wallet added support for AION, both for iOS and Android mobile wallets.  Besides, Syn\u00e1 wallet is available for AION holders.  The software comes as a fully integrated suite with Android, iOS apps and Google Chrome plugin supporting AION tokens.\n\nAion Team\n\nThe head of the company is Matthew Spoke, CEO, who enters the Board of Directors of Ethereum Enterprise Alliance.  Kesem Frank, co-founder, and COO, is in charge of roadmap execution.  Jin Tu, CTO of the company, has immense experience in the corporate engineering and blockchain industry.\n\nThe OAN started collaborating with the University of Waterloo in November 2019 to explore solutions to the challenge of preserving privacy in the context of Open Applications on blockchain networks.  In particular, work will be conducted over the development of cryptographic techniques, for example, Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Fully Homomorphic Encryption, to enable privacy-preserving interactions between user data and applications operating on this data.\n\nThe company New Alchemy provides advisory assistance for Aion.  Also, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, acts as an advisor of the platform.",

    "description": "Algorand is a decentralized, permissionless public blockchain based on the Proof-of-Stake consensus and fueled by a utility token ALGO.  The key target of the project is to enable a borderless economy based on the blockchain platform.  It aims to build fast and scalable cryptocurrency while sticking to the principles of decentralization.  The FAQ page on the project\u2019s website describes the borderless economy as the system where anything of value can be traded between two or more parties in a totally frictionless way.\n\nJust like many other blockchain projects that have emerged over the past years, Algorand targets to resolve the scalability problem inherent to Bitcoin and Ethereum.  As these two most popular cryptocurrencies are based on the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, they are pretty stable and secure.  But the architecture of these platforms allows BTC and ETH to process only 7 and 20 transactions per second accordingly.  This results in high latency when the networks get congested.  Algorand wants to find the perfect balance of security, decentralization, and scalability which is one of the biggest challenges for the blockchain industry to overcome.\n\nIn order to reach its goals, Algorand implements a unique consensus protocol called Pure Proof-Of-Stake (PPoS).  This protocol allows the system to achieve consensus without having to rely on any centralized party and stand against any malicious attack from the outside.  The chance for participants to create a new block is proportional to the size of their stakes, i.e.  to the amount of ALGO tokens they possess.\n\nThe consensus protocol is perfectly suited to provide the highest level of security and protect the system from malicious attacks as block validators are selected in a random and secret way.  There\u2019s no way to find out who the next validator is until the block is generated, and the block itself protects the information it contains.\n\nUnlike PoW-based cryptocurrencies, Algorand with the help of PoS eliminates the need for excessive electricity consumption and allows to process a much higher number of transactions per second without giving away decentralization.  Also, Algorand never forks which helps it maintain stability and speed and prevents malicious attacks on the network.  It\u2019s worth noting that Algorand is not the only PoS-based project as a similar concept is implemented by Cardano, Zilliqa, QuarkChain and some other platforms.\n\nAlgorand has managed to raise 66 million USD from private investors such as Union Square Ventures and Pillar Venture Capital in the course of 2018-2019.  In addition to that, the public token sale was launched on June 19th, 2019, and was conducted in a form of Dutch Auction which implies the gradual reduction of token price during a specified period.  This helped the project raise 60 million USD more for its future development.  On the same day, the Algorand mainnet was launched as well.\n\nAt that time, 25 million tokens were distributed, and Algorand plans to distribute via auction 600 million tokens more every year until the total supply reaches 10 billion ALGO.  ALGO tokens can be stored on the native mobile or desktop wallet which is available for download on Algorand\u2019s website.  The mobile wallet is created to work on both Android and iOS devices.  In addition, a desktop wallet Coinomi supports ALGO, but at the time of writing, it can\u2019t be kept in either Trezor or Ledger hardware wallets.\n\nIn August 2019, Algorand announced a 200 million ALGO staking rewards program which implied distributing rewards over the course of 6 months among those participants who manage to register their wallets before the block number 1618450 (August 31st).  In order to receive additional tokens, users had to pass the KYC (Know-Your-Customer) procedure and verify their identity within the following 6 months.\n\nAlgorand was founded by a cryptography pioneer and Turing award winner Silvio Micali in 2017.  Silvio has a scientific background as he has been working as a Ford Professor of Engineering at the faculty of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at MIT since 1983.  He has received his Laurea in Mathematics from the University of Rome, and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley.  Among other members of Algorand\u2019s team, there are many scientists and researchers as well.  The project\u2019s main location is Boston, Massachusets.  \n\nIn October 2019, Algo Capital, Algorand\u2019s key investor, lost roughly 2 million dollars in USDT and ALGO tokens after its CTO Pablo Yabo\u2019s phone was breached.  Algorand took full responsibility for the loss and claimed to reimburse the whole amount in 20 months.  The Algorand network itself has never been hacked and neither it was affected by the breach as most of its funds were kept on cold wallets.  However, after the incident, Yabo reportedly resigned from his position.",

    "description": "Ample token (AMPL) that was developed by Ampleforth is a new synthetic commodity that was created for risk diversification.  The coin is an ERC-20 token created on the Ethereum blockchain.  It is designed to resist price correlation with traditional assets and the most famous cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.  This digital currency is a kind of adaptive money that depends upon market conditions.\n\nThe project was created by Evan Kuo who studied mechanical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley.  He worked previously as CEO in the company Pythagoras Pizza that became known after it tokenized its franchise to acquire the same economic mobility as tech startup teams.  In this way, the employees of the company, its clients, affiliates, third-party delivery drivers could earn tokens performing small tasks for the company thus earning its share in it.  This approach attracted the attention of investors from Pantera Capital who introduced Evan to Brandon Isles, a former employee of Uber and Google.\n\nThe goal of the project\n\nAmpleforth tries to establish itself as a denationalized currency of the world that would compete against national currencies.  It would make governmental bodies increase the quality of national currencies not to lose citizens that use them.  In the opinion of the project\u2019s founder, it\u2019s necessary to develop the next generation of synthetic commodities to make it real.  They contribute to the creation of an independent new asset class to diversify portfolios of investors.\n\nThe mechanism behind the AMPL token\n\nThe coin was developed by Kuo and Iles with the help of specialists from the Hoover Institute who helped them to write a whitepaper.  The model for the coin was the theoretical currency Ducat offered by the philosopher and economist Fredrich Hayek.\n\nThe founder of the project considers that it\u2019s easier to redesign money than attempt to redesign the banking system.  It is easier to understand the technical mechanism behind the cryptocurrency than to understand its essence.  \n\nThe main feature of AMPL is the adjustment of supply and demand.  The supply grows when the demand increases and, on the contrary, decreases when the demand subsides.  The scheme was developed for preserving purchasing power despite economic pressure.  Some people confuse the notion of adaptive money with stablecoins which is wrong, although it pursues the same goal as stablecoins.  Also, the coin is not backed by USD and doesn\u2019t have locked assets.\n\nAmpleforth has developed a decentralized finance protocol for smart commodity-money.  The platform tries to create an ecosystem with partnerships and rapid community growth.  It\u2019s interesting to mention that the coin isn\u2019t pegged to the current dollar as stablecoins are, but is pegged to its rate in 2019.  Otherwise, its value would be lower.  Taking into account inflation, the AMPL token presents a higher value than stablecoins that are pegged to the US dollar, which suffered from inflation (2-3% loss in purchasing power compared to the USD average rate in 2019).\n\nTo attract liquidity to the platform, Ampleforth Geyser was launched in cooperation with Uniswap.  The users are rewarded for their deposits in AMPL tokens into the Uniswap protocol.  The amount of return depends upon the amount of the tokens and the duration of your participation in the program.  It was launched on June 24th, 2020, for a period of three months that can be extended in case of necessity.  At the time of writing, the period of duration hasn\u2019t been defined yet.  However, the team and the founder of the platform are satisfied with the results of this experiment and its efficacy.\n\nAmpleforth security\n\nThe company is often audited to discover issues and vulnerabilities in the source code of smart contracts.  Ampleforth regularly applies to CertiK\u2019s formal verification platform for a comprehensive examination.  The codebase is also accessed to ensure compliance with the best practices of the industry.  Smart contract engineers make a report to ensure proof of stability and come up with recommendations to address the issues discovered.\n\nICO, IEO, and financial details\n\nThe modification of the Ampleforth supply occurs daily so that the supply could meet demand.  The smart contract employs trusted oracles such as Chainlink price oracle, proprietary Ampleforth oracle.  With their help, it obtains prices from Bitfinex and Kucoin to see if the average market price of the coin remained within a certain price range that specialists name an equilibrium range.  The deviation shouldn\u2019t exceed 5% of a US dollar.  Thus, the price shouldn\u2019t be lower than 0.96 USD and shouldn\u2019t exceed 1.06 USD.  The results received from these checks affect Ample\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nAmpleforth conducted an ICO twice in 2018 and IEO that took place on the Bitfinex exchange in June 2019.  Though ICOs were successful (3 million USD and 1.75 million USD), the IEO was even more so.  It achieved the record-breaking results as AMPL tokens were sold out within 11 seconds and brought 4.9 million USD to the company.  It was necessary to be KYC-compliant for the participants.  In total, the company managed to raise 10 million USD (from ICOs and IEO).  The investors of the platform include Pantera Capital, Brian Armstrong, Huobi Capital, and others.\n\nThose who want to buy AMPL can apply to the cryptocurrency exchange.  In particular, such platforms as Kucoin and Bitfinex offer these digital assets.  AMPL tokens can be stored on any wallet that supports Ethereum as this is an ERC-20 token.  If you want to use hardware alternatives, it\u2019s better to regard Trezor or Ledger that are considered to be the most secure hardware wallets.  Among the software wallets, such options as web Exodus Wallet, a desktop and mobile MyEtherWallet, and Trust Wallet can be recommended.\n\nAmpleforth team\n\nApart from the CEO Evan Kuo and Brandon Iles mentioned above, it\u2019s also worth noting such members of the team as Ahmed Naguib Aly, a backend developer and engineer, a former Google employee, Nithin Krishna, a backend developer and engineer, who previously worked as a research engineer at the IRDS/IMSC labs.\n\nThe team includes academics, engineers, investors, and mere enthusiasts of the idea who graduated from MIT, Harvard, Yale, and Stanford.  The project is supported by Brian Armstrong, Huobi and Coinbase CEO who studied with Iles and Pantera Capital mentioned above.",

    "description": "Fueled by a native utility token ANT, Aragon is a decentralized blockchain-based platform aiming to facilitate the development of decentralized applications.  The Aragon project is run by the Aragon foundation, based in Switzerland.  The project was started in November 2016, by its founders Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo and was officially introduced to the public on February 10th next year in a blog post.  It gained support from Tim Draper, a venture capitalist, who bought about 2.5 percent of Aragon\u2019s total token supply.  The project is open-source and is built to let anyone open and run their own Ethereum-based decentralized organization.  Its token provides its owners with the right to make decisions on the future development of the platform.  The project is working on building its own network which is going to be the world\u2019s first digital jurisdiction.\n \nThe Aragon technology\n \nThe team wants the project to be a neutral jurisdiction for everyone willing to create a blockchain-based organization.  It is considered by the team to be the best organization form since it allows to reduce costs and save the budget as a shared platform can help to remove extra fees, delays and middlemen.  The Aragon dApp includes \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d features that represent standard core administrative functions of any company to make it easy and simple to operate a blockchain-based organization.  The team also hopes that this will boost the corporate adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain represents quite a powerful technology, but most companies, even those that interested in it, lack expertise.  That\u2019s the problem the project\u2019s out-of-the-box features are designed to solve.  Aragon provides a module for identity management and closely related modules for ownership and access control, as well as a variety of other modules.  They include accounts payable/receivable, shareholder voting, fundraising through token generation, HR onboarding and payroll, etc., thus covering the crucial aspects that make any company work.\n\nAlso, using new technology always means facing bugs, thus, the software should be able to be upgraded quickly and easily.  That\u2019s what Aragon also implements in these solutions as the project establishes an arbitration system to solve the conflicts.\n \nThe Aragon ICO\n\nThe Aragon token sale took place in May, 2017.  According to the company, it was the 4th largest crowdfunding event in history at that time.  About 25 million USD was raised in only 26 minutes.  ANT is a utility token, but it also can be used as a voting token.  It is listed on such exchanges as Bittrex, HitBTC, Bitfinex, Bancor and Livecoin exchanges.\n70% of tokens were given away via a private and public sale, 15% of tokens went to the project\u2019s foundation, and the remaining 15% went to the early contributors and founders of Aragon.  ANT can be stored on any ERC-20 wallet, such as Metamask or MyEtherWallet.\n \nThe Aragon team\n \nLuis Cuende is leading the project.  Prior to launching Aragon, he founded Stampery, a time-stamping project on the Blockchain network, and has worked with the Estonian Government, Microsoft and Telefonica.  In addition, he was listed in Forbes \u201c30 under 30\u201d.  In 2011, he received a \u201cBest Underage European Programmer\u201d award.  He advised the Vice President of the European Commission and is an MIT Innovators Under 35 awardee.  He has founded several startups and created the first Linux distribution with face login.\n \nJorge Izquierdo is the Tech lead who has been creating applications since his youth.  He got the Thiel fellowship and Apple\u2019s WWDC scholarship when he was just 15 years old.\n \nAragon\u2019s advisors are also quite established in the blockchain world.  These are Jake Brukhman, a co-founder of CoinFund, and Brayton Williams, a founding partner at Boost VC.  Mihai Alisie is the co-founder of Ethereum blockchain and the founder of next-gen social network AKASHA.",

    "description": "Ardor is a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides businesses and institutions with the whole environment for setting up their own chains without having to code themselves.  Fueled by a native cryptocurrency ARDR, it has a unique parent-child architecture.  Ardor as a parent provides the network itself and interoperable child chains come with a rich set of features.  This approach provides developers not only with the needed flexibility, but also helps to eliminate other industry issues such as single token dependency, scalability, and blockchain bloat.  Ardor comes with a built-in exchange helping users easily convert tokens from different chains between each other.\n\nArdor offers businesses an out-of-the-box solution for deploying their own blockchain-based apps, smart contracts and other features.  Similar to well-known Software as a Service (SaaS) business structure, the project takes responsibility for maintaining the whole infrastructure and all the related headaches.\nSolving problems of NXT\nArdor was created on a basis of the Nxt blockchain by their parent company Jelurida based in the Netherlands.  The main goal behind creating a new version of Nxt was to resolve some critical issues that Jelurida has discovered while working on the initial project:\n\nSingle token.  Nxt is fueled by a native token NXT required for every transaction which creates additional inconveniences for the users.  Ardor makes it possible to use the currency of the child chain to carry out transactions.\nBlockchain bloat.  This problem is inherent to most blockchain networks.  It implies the necessity to download the entire blockchain for every new validator as every node keeps the records about all transactions that have ever occurred over time.  Ardor suggests holding only those transactions that affect the balance of validating nodes.  Every new node added to the chain only has to validate transactions of the parent chain.\nCustomization.  In order to use the blockchain technologies at their fullest, businesses need some level of customization to be able to create their own blockchains with their own set of features.  Nxt didn\u2019t provide the appropriate level of customization, so Ardor came out with a solution to this problem giving companies a chance to request customized features.\nArdor key features\nWith the mainnet launched on January 1th, 2018, Ardor has come out with a set of features to help businesses roll out their products on the platform, such as:\n\nAliasing which helps to create accounts with names that are easy to remember and thus facilitates transactions.\nData cloud which allows storing data securely in a decentralized manner.\nAccount control with sophisticated options to control users\u2019 actions.\nThe monetary system that allows creating custom tokens to be used on subsidiary chains.\nSecure messaging which allows communicating in an encrypted way.\nCoinShuffle which helps users to quickly and securely move funds.\nVoting which allows conducting polls in a decentralized and anonymous way.\nPlug-ins to customize functionality further.\nArdor coin ARDR\nThe Ardor network has its own native cryptocurrency ARDR.  No ICO was ever conducted as the coins were distributed among NXT holders based on their balances.  Next 1.0 users received and amount of ARDR tokens equal to the average NXT balance.  To calculate this average balance, the first snapshot of the system was taken on July 14th, 2017 and the last one ended on the network block number 1,000,000.  The new coins are released with the help of the Proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n\nFor those who want to purchase the ARDR tokens, this option is supported by many reputable exchange platforms, such as Bilaxy, Binane, Huobi, and HitBTC.  The coins can be stored on a native Ardor wallet which is available on the web and as an Android app version.\nArdor team\nThe company Jelurida was launched in 2016 with the initial goal to develop the Nxt platform.  There are three co-founders who also stand behind Ardor.  They are:\nKristina Kalcheva.  Having International Relations Degree from Sofia University and being a Master of Law, she\u2019s responsible for all legal questions that Jelurida comes across.  Her professional skills are mostly related to the private national, European and International law.\nLior Yaffe.  Having started his career at the end of the \u201990s, Lior has 20+ years of experience in design, development, and deployment of business applications for big companies.\nPetko Petkov.  With a Master\u2019s degree that he received at Sofia University, Petkov has worked as a software engineer since 2006, having changed a few software companies.  He started off as a mobile Java developer and later switched tot he server-side Java software.",

    "description": "Ark is a new cryptocurrency ecosystem aimed to provide users with some real-world applications for day-to-day use which is accomplished through several innovative achievements in basic techniques.\n\nWith that in mind, the company develops an ecosystem which intends to make it easier for users to accept blockchain technology.  The company started to develop its activity at the end of 2016.  During that period, the developers worked out a basic core featuring a high level of security and efficiency thanks to which transactions confirmation is made within a few seconds.  A new currency quickly acquired popularity among users and obtained support of numerous cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe developers of the platform try to make blockchain technologies more available for all, reducing the cost and speed of the financial transactions for all users preserving their anonymity.\n\nArk crypto-project is a combination of Bitshares \u0438 Lisk.  At the same time, the founders tried to take the best from both cryptocurrencies and deliver the best financial instrument to their users, giving them the opportunity to make quick and safe financial operations.\n\nThe main goal of the project\n\nThe team developing Ark tries to use their unique approach to solve the problems, which are common for blockchains, such as security, speed of transactions, and scalability which is achieved by deployment of side chains.\n\nThe main goal of the project is removing the barriers preventing users from entering the cryptocurrency area.  People perceive this technology as something very complicated, staying beyond their understanding.  Therefore, the Ark crew adjusted it to users\u2019 needs and made blockchain technology more accessible for common users and developers.  A person or a company can create their own standalone blockchain within minutes using the functionality of the platform.  The blockchain project with functional SmartBridges and newly deployed chains can be launched with a single click on a button.\n\nArk\u2019s main technologies\n\nArk employs a range of technologies that attract attention to this project and help it to stand out from competitors, thus strengthening its position in the cryptocurrency market.  The system uses SmartBridge to connect the existing blockchain technologies with ARK Ecosystem.  It helps to create a reliable platform delivering a new level of platform-user cooperation.\n\nAlthough ARK platform does not offer direct support of side chains or decentralized databases, its solution includes a bridge connection method built in its core code.  The bridge function allows other blockchains to send and to get notifications about trigger functions, and also information data through intellectual bridges.  SmartBridges can also be used to connect \u201ccentralized\u201d services.\n\nTo promote the project further, Ark team integrated many programming languages making it convenient to work with for any developer.  The supported languages include Java, Go, Ruby, Swift iOS, PHP/Laravel, NET, Python, RPC and Elixer.  \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting Ark\u2019s fast transaction speed.  With new blocks generated every 8 second, Ark can be considered as one of the fastest blockchain projects (just to compare: Ethereum generates new blocks once in 14 seconds, with Bitcoin this process takes 10 minutes on the average).  Also, Ark can process up to 25 transactions per second.  It\u2019s still not much, but the project doesn\u2019t stop on these achievements and wants to work further to make transactions even faster increasing their number per block.\n\nThe system uses Delegated Proof of Stake or DPoS consensus algorithm with 51 delegates chosen via voting to process transactions.  The delegates are rewarded with ARK coins for their work.  To vote for a delegate, it\u2019s sufficient to have at least 1 ARK on your wallet as this is exactly the fee that you pay for the action.  The delegates submit proposals for the network\u2019s improvements and other members of the community vote for these proposals with their tokens.\n \nThe Ark ICO\n\nThe ICO was conducted from November 7th until December 11th, 2016, helping the team to raise 22 million USD.  During the public sale, the company accepted direct payments in Lisk, ETH, Bitcoin, and numerous altcoins via Shapeshift.  125 million tokens were distributed to investors making up 75% of the total supply.\n\nAs for the remaining supply, it was distributed in the following way: 15% is allocated to the founders, 7% set aside for ARKShield program, 2% was reserved for bounties and 1% held in escrow.\n\nARK is a utility token that is used to pay for transactions within the system.  ARK is traded on Binance, Bittrex, Upbit, OKEx, LiteBit.eu, COSS and many other platforms.  The holders can store their funds on the official ARK wallet, which has paper, desktop, mobile, and web versions.\n\nThe ARK Team\n\nThe coin was founded by the team of blockchain experts and enthusiasts from different countries of the world.  At the time of writing, there are 36 core members from 9 different regions.\n\nThe President of the company is Francois Thoorens who is also a co-founder of the platform along with its Vice President Rok \u010cernec.  The executive team also includes Kristjan Ko\u0161i\u010d, CTO of the project.\n\nSupervisory Board consists of 3 specialists: Matthew Cox or GreXX, a Chief Strategist of Ark and father of Munchkins, Lars Rensing, a Vice-Chairman, holding 2 board and advisor roles as Advisor at DigitalBits and ICO Advisor at Blockport, and Scott McPherson, MD, the Board Member at ARK Ecosystem, SCIC (ARK.io).\n\nArk\u2019s strategic partners\n\nThe company partners with nOS that develops a virtual operating system and other products based on NEO.  Another Ark\u2019s key partner is WOLFRAM that offers computational intelligence for smart contracts and crypto asset analytical tools.  The list of famous partners also includes Ledger that develops customizable infrastructure solutions protecting crypto assets, and Changelly, an intermediary between crypto exchanges and users, providing security and easiness of transactions.",

    "description": "Cosmos (ATOM) is a decentralized network of independent blockchains, each powered by Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.  Atom is the native staking token of the Cosmos Network.  The Cosmos vision is to build an \u201cinternet of blockchains\u201d that can scale and interoperate with one another.  \n\nOpen source tools like Tendermint Core, the Cosmos SDK, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) were created to accelerate the creation of blockchains in the Cosmos Network.\n\nTendermint Core is a BFT consensus algorithm.  With the Tendermint consensus algorithm, users get \u201cinstant finality,\u201d which means forks are never created as long as more than a third of the Validators are honest.  Transactions are finalized as soon as a block is created (unlike proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum).\n\nThe Cosmos SDK is a generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint Core.  IBC is a protocol that connects independent blockchains together.  IBC allows heterogeneous chains to transfer value or data to each other and can work with any \u201cfast-finality\u201d blockchain engine.\n\nThe Cosmos Network consists of independent blockchains called \u201cZones\u201d which are attached to central blockchains called \u201cHubs.\u201d  Each Zone and Hub can choose its own BFT consensus algorithm and governance. \n\nThe first Hub in the Cosmos Network is the Cosmos Hub which launched in March of 2019.  The Cosmos Hub utilizes Tendermint Core which is a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol.   At the time of this writing, there are 100 Validators who secure the Cosmos Hub.  Validators get rewarded with Atom tokens for each block they produce.  Every year, the maximum number of Cosmos Hub Validators will increase according to a set schedule.  Atom token holders who do not qualify as Validators can stake their tokens with a Validator to earn rewards.\n\nThe Cosmos Network is supported by the Swiss non-profit organization called the Interchain Foundation (ICF).  Tendermint Inc is a California-based software company contracted by the ICF to develop the Cosmos Network.  Jae Kwon is the President of the Interchain Foundation and the CEO of Tindermint Inc.  Before Cosmos, Kwon was a Lead Mobile Developer at Yelp and a Developer at Flywheel Networks.  \n\n\nCosmos held their ICO in April 2017 and raised $17 million.  75 percent of the available token supply was sold in the ICO, 5 percent was withheld for seed investors, 10 percent was distributed to Tendermint Inc, and the last 10 percent was allocated to the Interchain Foundation.\n\nThe Cosmos mainnet launched on March 14, 2019.  On the same day, the Tendermint team announced their Series A investment round, raising $9 million.  The investment was led by Paradigm and included Bain Capital, 1confirmation, and other notable investors.",

    "description": "AVAX is a utility token issued by the decentralized cryptocurrency platform Avalanche in 2020.  Avalanche is a groundbreaking decentralized consensus protocol sometimes abbreviated as AVA.  Avalanche became the first smart contracts platform with the capability to confirm transactions in less than a second.  The protocol is able to support the Ethereum development kit fully and enable millions of full block producers.  The project attracted much attention in connection with the major problem of the Ethereum blockchain which is the speed of transactions.  The popularity of the network is so high that a large number of transactions entail its frequent clogging.  The speed of transactions processing offered by Avalanche is similar to Visa as it\u2019s capable of processing 4500 TPS (some resources claim that this number equals 6500), while Ethereum is able to process 19 transactions a second only.   \n\nThe development of the project was initiated by the AVA Labs team.  John Wu, President of Ava Labs, considers that the project has a great impact on the institutional finance and the DeFi sphere.  \n\nAvalanche platform and technologies\n\nAvalanche utilizes an open-source proof-of-stake protocol that features a high level of performance and security.  One of its main benefits is the capability to scale to support millions of users.  The core innovation of the project is a novel consensus mechanism which is a fusion of a directed acyclic graph structure and \u201crepeated subsampled voting.\u201d\n\nSupporting application-specific sharding, the protocol empowers developers to launch apps meeting their specific demands.  The programmability of application and network levels delivered by the platform gives developers the possibility to control the execution of their decentralized apps and secure management of their private data.  \n\nThe platform features two consensus engines: a DAG-optimized consensus protocol Avalanche and a chain-optimized consensus protocol Snowman for smart contracts.  \n\nThe architecture of the platform includes subnetwork empowered by validators who work together to achieve consensus.  The subnets are uniquely tailored blockchains supported by the main network of Avalanche.  They are created with a specific goal, as a rule, to meet the demands of its validators.  It\u2019s possible to launch the customized blockchains that can be either private or public.  Special parameters and trading restrictions are set by a Virtual Machine that obeys them in accordance with specific demands.  A Virtual Machine is a code that uses consensus for the production of a database.  \n\nThe validator should be a member of the Primary Network that includes three blockchains: P-Chain (platform chain), X-Chain (exchange chain), and C-Chain (contracts chain).  P-Chain coordinates validators, keeping track of subnets, and making other subnets possible.  It is also in charge of the implementation of Snowman consensus protocol.  X-Chain is an asset chain enabling the creation of new assets and exchange of assets and transfers between subnets.  It is responsible for the implementation of the Avalanche consensus protocol.  \n\nThe Avalanche platform features Byzantine tolerance.  Though its certain configurations enable up to 50% of the Byzantine nodes that potentially can cause the imbalance in the network, they are still unable to do it technically.  \n\nThe available Avalanche resources include AvalancheGo with a full suite of JSON RPCs for the interaction with the virtual machine APIs in the network.  It comes with IPC, KeyStore, metrics, and Admin APIs for the interaction with the nodes.  The list also includes the Avash program for the creation of local networks, their automation, the launch of subnets, and deployment of chains with their further integration into CI pipelines; Avalanche Wallet and Faucet to send and receive funds via the network,  and AvalancheJS, the JavaScript library for the interaction with Avalanche APIs that enables Avalanche integration with decentralized apps and customization of virtual machines using the plugins created for the extension of AvalancheJS functionality.  \n\nAVAX token\n\nThe native token of Avalanche is AVAX with a capped supply of 720 million tokens.  Half of the sum (360M AVAX) is a mainnet supply.  AVAX is a utility token that is needed to pay for operations and have access to an extensive set of utility services.  The system uses the token burning scheme for the balance of the network.  The transaction fees are burnt thus creating AVAX scarcity.  AVAX is also used as a governance token as it gives the possibility to establish the main economic parameters of the system and decide upon the staking amount and reward size.  \n\nAvalanche token sale was arranged on July 15th, 2020, and continued for a couple of weeks.  Different options were offered to customers who could select the option with one-year vesting at a price of 0.50 USD per token with quarterly unlocking, 1.5-year vesting with the same terms for the 4 hours of the sale and with no locks at 0.85 USD per token.  The maximum check size is limited to 25K USD and 5K USD, correspondingly.

    "description": "BAND is an ERC-20 token of the Band Protocol.  Band protocol solves the problem of access to services and trusted data creating a decentralized bridge for that.  The protocol presents a cross-chain data oracle developed on the Cosmos Network that enables secure operations between smart contracts and the traditional web.  Aggregating first real-world data and connecting them later to smart contracts via API, the bridge delivers off-chain information to public blockchains with high speed and low latency.  The cross-chain data oracle has attained incredible growth in 2020, recording a 348 percent growth in July alone.\n\nThe system is rather flexible and can serve most of the publicly available blockchains, supporting different methods of data retrieving and aggregating.  It can get information from permissionless sources along with the ones protected by centralized parties.\n\nBandChain technologies\n\nThe team of the company has developed the blockchain specifically for off-chain data curation.  Supporting generic data requests, it also employs WebAssembly-powered oracle scripts.  That data aggregated on BandChain is sent to other blockchains through Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol.  Alternatively, one-way customized bridges can be involved in that.\n\nOracle Data Proof employed by BandChain is a Merkle proof showing the existence of the final result of the data request on BandChain.  The smart contracts can use this proof later on the other blockchain as well after the data is decoded.\n\nBand Protocol employs also such technologies as Tendermint's Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm, Tendermint powerful tools, and others for efficient work of the blockchain.\n\nThe protocol presupposes the contribution of validators who perform important functions on the network, participating in the block consensus protocol by broadcasting votes with cryptographic signatures.  Validators are rewarded with BAND tokens.  BandChain validators are the candidates with most tokens staked to them.  Their participation is required for most transactions of the ecosystem such as asset transfer, staking, slashing, and others.\n\nBAND token\n\nBAND tokens are used as a reward to validators for the production of new blocks.  The members of the community can use the tokens to become validators, delegate their holdings to another validator, and to participate in the chain\u2019s governance.  The platform allows validators to establish fees for their work.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to buy BAND on Coinone, Huobi Global, Coinbase, Binance, Bilaxy, and on the largest crypto-fiat VISA card provider Crypto.com.  If a personal wallet is needed, the tokens can be stored on Ledger Nano S or Trezor.  Trust Wallet officially supported by Binance can also be a good solution for storing BAND tokens.  \n\nBAND Team\n\nSoravis Srinawakoon, the co-founder and CEO of Band Protocol, is a graduate of Stanford University.  He asserts that the protocol will contribute to the creation of a new system of dApps built on the Binance Smart Chain.  In his opinion, this technology will bring Binance and Band Protocol at the forefront of DeFi as the integration of Band Protocol\u2019s oracle allows developers to build innovative dApps in the Binance ecosystem.  \n\nOther key figures of the project include Sorawit Suriyakarn, CTO and co-founder, MIT graduate who previously worked for Hudson River Trading, Quora, and Dropbox; and Paul Nattapatsiri, CPO and co-founder who previously created crypto-games with over 800 k users.\n\nThe platform is backed by such companies as Binance, Sequoia Capital, Woodstock, Spartan Group, and other large companies.",

According to the website, the Basic Attention Token will \u201cbe utilized to directly measure, exchange, and verify attention.\u201d \n\nAn essential element of the BAT ecosystem is Brave, an open-source, privacy-centered browser that blocks ads and trackers by default.  If a user wants to earn BAT, they can change their settings to make ads viewable.  Advertisers buy ads with BAT tokens, which are then dispersed to publishers (for hosting ads) and browser users (for viewing ads). \n\nBrave uses blockchain technology to anonymously monitor user attention so that users and publishers can be compensated accordingly with BAT.  Token holders will be able to use BAT for premium content or services on the BAT platform or tip them to publishers of their choice.  The ambitious goal of BAT is to rid the internet of the current online advertising system (along with the middlemen and trackers) and transform digital advertising so that users maintain their privacy, advertisers achieve higher ROI, and publishers receive more revenue.\n\nFor publishers who want access to their BAT tips, they must first be verified.  By signing up as a verified Brave publisher, content creators can obtain their tokens and even exchange them to a currency of their choice.  At the time of this writing, there are over 28,000 verified Brave publishers which include The Guardian, Archive.org, the Washington Post, SourceForge, Nomics.com, and many others.\n\nBrave Software, the company that created BAT, was founded in 2015 by Brendan Eich (CEO) and Brian Bondy (CTO). Before Brave, Eich created JavaScript and co-founded Mozilla while Bondy spent time at Mozilla and Khan Academy as a senior software engineer.\n\nOn May 31st, 2017, BAT held an ICO and raised $35 million in less than 1 minute. 1 billion BAT tokens were sold while an additional 500 million were retained by the company, for a total of 1.5 billion tokens.\n\nThe BAT project is backed by numerous investors including Founders Fund, Foundation Capital, Propel Venture Partners, Pantera Capital, DCG, and many others.\n\nBrave Software is headquartered in San Francisco.",

    "description": "BitConnect coin (BCC) is a cryptocurrency that was used within the ill-famous peer-to-peer payment platform BitConnect.  It was one of the most well-known Ponzi schemes that have ever taken place in the digital world and its crash caused one of the most abrupt collapses affecting the whole cryptocurrency market.  The company BitConnect Ltd. was registered in 2016 in the UK.  Initially posted on BitcoinTalk in November 2016, the project has attracted a lot of negative attention from the very start.\n\nThe ICO was carried out from November 15th to December 31st and successfully raised the needed amount despite the community\u2019s attitude.  The number of tokens was limited to 28 million with 4 million of those given away via ICO.  The rest of the BCC coins were distributed via the combination of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithms.  The switch was supposed to happen when the number of blocks reached 262,800.  For each newly created block, miners received a reward of 10 BCC.  After switching to PoS, BCC holders were to receive a monthly reward of 10% of their stake.  The payouts were to be reduced down to 8%, 7%, 5% and 1,4% every 6 months after that.\n\nThe initial idea of the project was to popularize Bitcoin usage, however, after the ICO, BitConnect focused on attracting people to buy BCC.  The platform was designed to work in the following way.  Users were exchanging bitcoins for BitConnect tokens on their exchange platform gaining daily profits in the form of dividends.  The size of investors\u2019 income depended on the number of other people that each of them invited to the platform.  The company claimed to have developed a special investment algorithm that implied purchasing Bitcoin at low prices and selling when its value was high.  That\u2019s how the profits were assumably generated.  However, no details of how this algorithm worked have ever been publicly provided which caused more suspicions.\n\nIn addition, the following aspects of BitConnect should have made investors more careful: The promises of a stable income of 120% per year on quite an unstable market of cryptocurrencies. No information about people who stood behind the project and how they were going to achieve their goals. No white paper.  Also, the platform was promoting a referral program which was strongly advertised by many cryptocurrency-oriented channels on YouTube.  The owners of these channels were getting more profits as more people were joining BitConect via their personal referral links.  The BCC coins were used mostly within BitConnect itself and it was difficult to exchange them as not many platforms supported them.  Users could make long-term investments or use BCC to make loans.  To do that, they had to upload their bitcoins to the platform, switch them to BitConnect native coins and loan them to the bot which was trading them on BitConnect\u2019s exchange platform.  The funds had to be frozen on users\u2019 accounts for 120-299 days with the interest (up to 30% per month) being accrued to the amount kept on users\u2019 wallets.  The offer looked really tasty and it\u2019s no wonder that it attracted so many freebie-lovers.\n\nThe BCC token price grew from a post-ICO level of 0.17 USD to almost 500 USD per coin at the beginning of December 2017.  Eventually, its vague scheme of making money drew the attention of the US authorities, and in a couple of weeks, the project received cease and desist orders from the regulators.  The company decided to close the project on January 16th, 2018, making it impossible for investors to withdraw their earnings.  On January 31st, the US District Court, Western District of Kentucky, issued a temporary restraining order and froze the company\u2019s assets.  The price of BCC dropped even faster as it lost more than 95% of its all-time-high index in a matter of a few days.  This was one of the biggest collapses in the whole history of cryptocurrencies and the whole market turned red that day.\n\nAt the time of writing, there still exists a page on the FBI's official website seeking victims in the BitConnect investigation.  The page contains a form with a questionnaire that BCC investors can complete with a negligible hope to gain their funds back one day.  One may think that cryptocurrency investors might have learned their lesson after such a large-scale deception, but projects similar to BitConnect keep arising again and again, although the hype around them is not that big.  One of such projects was launched by the creators of BitConnect themselves.  It\u2019s called BitConnectX Genesis and it has all the same attributes of a Ponzi scheme that the original project had.",

    "symbol": "BCD",
    "name": "Bitcoin-Diamond",
    "description": "Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is Bitcoin\u2019s hard fork that occurred on November 24, 2017, and resulted in the creation of an entirely new blockchain while the original Bitcoin network continued on unaltered. Those users who had any bitcoins stored on their BTC wallets at the time of the fork have received the new cryptocurrency at the ratio of 10 BCD to 1 BTC. Such a ratio is a result of an increased total supply of coins, as BCD has the limit 10 times bigger than BTC (210 million BCD vs 21 million BTC). BCD is available for trading on many top exchanges including Bithump, OKEx, Binance, and Huobi Global.  The new network has the same transaction history as the original one before the fork, and after branching, transaction history splits into two different directions. After the fork, BCD miners started creating new blocks of increased size using an alternative proof-of-work algorithm X13. The main goal of creating new cryptocurrency was to reduce transaction fees that reached their highest in that period due to the increased interest towards Bitcoin with its spiking price.  When the project was just launched, it aroused many questions, as there was neither white paper, nor a shaped community, nor even an account on GitHub. However, despite the scarcity of the information, the price spiked from 62 USD to 94 USD in less than 24 hours. It turned out to be an all-time-high index for BCD. It was followed by a few short-term spikes, but the price has only slowly declined ever since. Soon after the launch, the project\u2019s team released the source code on GitHub and significantly improved communication processes on social media reducing concerns and getting rid of scam labels.  According to the project\u2019s white paper, one of the core Bitcoin\u2019s issues that the new cryptocurrency aims to resolve is slow transaction speed. Bitcoin block size is only 2-4 MB and it is capable of processing 7 transactions per second at the maximum. For comparison, VISA processes 1,700 TPS at the average on a daily basis with the potential to handle up to 24,000 TPS. Bitcoin Diamond increases the block size up to 8 MB. This cannot help it reach VISA\u2019s indices, but it still offers a ponderable improvement on the Bitcoin\u2019s network as BCD is capable of performing 100 TPS.  Another technical improvement that Bitcoin Diamond\u2019s team has implemented in order to increase the network capacity is the Lightning Network. With this second-layer payment protocol, users can create dedicated channels and conduct transactions between each other at the speed of lightning with near-to-zero fees within the deposited amount. Once the channel gets closed, all transactions are uploaded to the main network as a single bunch.  Apart from these technical improvements, Bitcoin Diamond also aims to make mining accessible for regular people. The new cryptocurrency is based on X-13 which is a modification of the Proof-of-Work algorithm underlying Bitcoin. This algorithm facilitates the mining process on graphic cards (GPUs) and complicates the process for the specialized mining equipment (ASICs) preventing big companies from monopolizing the market and giving the mining power back into the hands of end-users.  For those willing to mine Bitcoin Diamond, the core client is available for downloading on the project\u2019s official website. An important thing to know here is that together with the client, you will have to download the whole BCD blockchain to your PC to turn it into a node. This may require a substantial amount of hard drive space. For more steady rewards it is recommended to join one of the mining pools oriented on BCD. The list of such pools can be found on the project\u2019s official website as well.  Also, on the website, the page dedicated to the project\u2019s team says nothing about the founders. It claims that the team has decided to remain secret following their project\u2019s focus on the anonymity. However, it provides links to the LinkedIn profiles of other team members with a relevant background in the industry.",

    "description": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It\u2019s a permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrency that requires no trusted third parties and no central bank. It was created in 2017 after the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues. The plan for a Bitcoin alternative was pushed through by Bitcoin activists, investors, entrepreneurs, developers, and largely China-based miners. It was considered to be one of the most successful hard-forks of the original Bitcoin. At the time of the fork, anyone owning Bitcoin was also given the same number of Bitcoin Cash units. \n\n Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed. Because the blocks are larger and contain more information, more computational power is needed to process (or mine) them. \n\n The larger block sizes remove the need for Segregated Witness (SegWit), a code adjustment used by Bitcoin to free up block space by removing certain parts of the transaction. One issue the community had with SegWit was that it forced transactions to happen off-chain, breaking the economic incentives to make Bitcoin work. By using larger blocks and speeding up transaction process time it is hoped that Bitcoin Cash will remain on-chain and still be able to compete with the number of transactions established by financial platforms like Visa or Paypal. \n\n The Bitcoin Cash protocol ensures there will never be more than 21 million coins in existence. The platform states that no transaction is too big or too small and that their network is on 24-hours a day, 365 days a year. \n\n By the end of 2018, Bitcoin Cash boasted sub-cent transaction fees, it was accepted at around 670 physical locations around the world, which (it claimed) made it the most secure and widely used digital currency on the planet.",

    "description": "Bytecoin (BCN) is a privacy-centered cryptocurrency that launched in July 2012.  Based on the CryptoNote protocol which uses ring signatures and stealth addresses, the project claims that transactions are untraceable and unlinkable.\n\nBytecoin (BCN) should not be confused with Bytecoin (BTE), an inactive cryptoasset based off of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) protocol.\n\nEach transaction on the Bytecoin network utilizes a one-time public key.  By doing this, the problem of address re-use is eliminated and decreases the traceability of transactions.  To help obscure the connection between users and transactions, ring signatures are used.  With ring signatures, transactions are digitally signed by one member of a group (each having their own private keys), however, there is no way for an outside observer to determine which one actually signed it. \n\nBytecoin uses an egalitarian proof-of-work consensus algorithm called \u201cCryptoNight,\u201d designed to restrict ASIC mining and make CPU and GPU mining equally efficient.  Each block time on the Bytecon blockchain is 2 minutes (compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 10 minute block time).  To maintain a consistent block rate, the mining difficulty changes as the network hash rate increases and decreases after each block.  This protects the blockchain from \u201cfreezing up\u201d even when the system traffic spikes or has a sharp drop in the number of miners. \n\nBytecoin is considered one of the first privacy coins to exist in the space.  Monero (XMR), a popular privacy project, is actually a fork from the original Bytecoin protocol.  \n\nSome have criticized Bytecoin\u2019s mining history.  A prominent Monero developer argues that 82% of Bytecoins were pre-mined before the project was released to the public.  Bytecoin has a maximum total supply of 184.47 billion coins.  At the time of this writing, over 99% of the coins are already in circulation.\n\nThe founders of this privacy project are anonymous.",

    "description": "Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency issued by the popular trading platform Binance. The coin runs natively on the Ethereum blockchain and follows the ERC20 technical token standard. It is classified as a utility token and can be used on the Binance exchange. \n\n In July 2017, Binance held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB which helped it to raise $15 million. During the ICO process, the company offered 10% of the total number of coins (BNB 20 million) to angel investors, 40% (BNB 80 million) to the founding team, and the remaining 50% (BNB 100 million) to other participants. Holders of the BNB coin are referred to as Binancians. \n\n According to Binance\u2019s whitepaper, half the funds raised during the ICO were earmarked for branding and marketing, one-third were used to build the Binance platform and perform necessary upgrades to the Binance ecosystem, and 15% were kept in reserve for emergencies. \n\n The token was established with a total supply of 200 million, and a key influence on BNB\u2019s value is Binance\u2019s strategy to buy back a percentage of the coins and \u2018burn\u2019 them. Burning coins means taking them out of circulation and permanently destroying them. The benefit is that it increases the value of the remaining coins left in circulation. Binance has stated that it will use 20% of its profits from every quarter to buy back and burn BNB until the supply of the coin is 50% of the original amount (100 million BNB). Every buy-back transaction conducted by Binance is announced via the blockchain for transparency. \n\n The BNB token itself has multiple uses, essentially being the underlying gas that powers the Binance ecosystem. For the first year, Binance offered a 50% discount on its exchange trading fees using the coin. In its whitepaper, Binance has outlined plans to offer annually decreasing discounts on fees for BNB users until its fifth year of operation. \n\n There have been several other real-world use cases for BNB since its launch. In 2017 Monaco, which offers a Visa-branded credit card that converts cryptocurrencies into fiat payments, announced its plans to support BNB.  It can also be used on Uplive, Asia\u2019s premier high-end live video platform. \n\n BNB has become more usable for goods and services in a growing number of brick and mortar establishments around the world. Australian startup TravelbyBit, for example, has equipped more than 150 establishments, including Brisbane Airport, with the ability to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies including BNB. \n\n The token is also being used as a payment method on platforms made by blockchain startups such as crypto point-of-sale solutions provider Pundi X, blockchain payments company Crypto.com, and CoinPayments, which acts as a crypto point of sale for millions of online vendors around the globe. Binance also states that about 9 in 10 of its employees receive a portion of their salaries in the BNB token.",

    "description": "Bancor Network Token (BNT) is the hub token that serves as a link between all tokens, traded on the Bancor Network.  Thanks to BNT, all tokens, listed on the exchange, can be converted into each other.  The mechanics behind this is simple \u2013 BNT holds liquidity against ETH and every other token, traded on the Bancor Network.  That way, should one wants to convert ETH to LTC, for example, he can do that instantaneously thanks to BNT\u2019s connector balance in both cryptocurrencies.  The way it works allows for flexibility and ease of conversion between all tokens.\n\nThe Bancor Network team describes the BNT as \u201cthe world's first Liquid Token.\u201d BNT can be purchased by sending ETH to a particular address.  In return, the sender receives BNT tokens, according to their current price (which is estimated according to a methodology, developed by the Bancor Network team, and defined in the Bancor Protocol whitepaper).  BNT liquidation happens the same way around.  The amount of BNT in circulation is not static as BNT tokens are created each time when ETH is sent to their smart contract.  On the other hand, BNT tokens are destroyed every time a user sells his BNT back to the contract.\n\nBNT\u2019s flexibility is thanks to the Bancor Protocol (the operational model of the Bancor Network), which allows for the standardization of a new type of natively liquid brand token.  The authors of the Bancor Protocol Whitepaper describe the Bancor Network Token as a \u201ctoken for tokens.\u201d The fundamental pillars of the Bancor Protocol are the so-called \u201cSmart Tokens\u201d.  The smart tokens are ERC20 compliant tokens that hold one or multiple connector balances in their smart contracts.  Thanks to that, smart tokens can be traded against any of the tokens on the network (if they are present in their connector balances).  What all smart tokens have in common though, is that they hold a shared connector balance in BNT.  This makes all of them tradable against each other.  The conversion between tokens happens instantaneously, without the need for matching buyers and sellers and at continuously calculated rates.\n\nThe idea behind the creation of the Bancor Network Token is to ease the use of the Bancor Network and link all tokens into one system that allows for instant and easy conversion.  The operational model of the Network supposes that if there is significant buying interest in a specific token (ETH, for example), it will result into an increased supply of BNT since the supply of its sub token (ETH in that case) has grown through new deposits of BNT into the connector balance.\n\nThe BNT\u2019s Token Generation Event took place on June 12, 2017.  BNT then became the first smart token launched on the Bancor Network (a decentralized cross-chain liquidity network).  The BNT is managed by the Bprotocol Foundation, a nonprofit, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, that aims to promote the Bancor Protocol as the leading global standard for Smart Tokens.\n\nThe Bancor project has four co-founders - Eyal Hertzog, Galia Benartzi, Guy Ben-Artzi, and Yudi Levi.  All of them are known for their vast experience in the tech field and venture capital industry.  The Bancor Foundation has also attracted industry experts from a variety of industries.  The board of the Foundation consists of 13 members among which can be distinguished the names of Tim Draper, founder of Draper University and Draper Associates, John Henry Clippinger, research scientist at MIT and strategic advisor to multiple organizations, Brock Pierce, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation and co-founder of EOS Alliance, Yoni Assia, founder and CEO of eToro, Justin Rosenstein, co-founder of Asana and others.  The Network was lead by the well-respected international monetary policy expert Bernard Lietaer before his death on February 4, 2019.",

The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. \n\n The white paper, entitled \u2018Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u2019 outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network. \n\n Bitcoin was first released as version 0.1 in January 2009, by Satoshi and was published on SourceForge, an online collaboration platform for developers. In 2017, the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created which increased the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed. \n\n In November 2018, there was a difference in opinion between the Bitcoin Cash community over stability, scalability, security, and safety issues. This caused a so-called \u2018hash war\u2019 as two developer camps fought for control of the Bitcoin fork, which ended in a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash. The result was the creation of Bitcoin SV which is intended to provide a clear Bitcoin implementation choice for miners and allow businesses to build applications and websites on it reliably. \n\n Leading the charge for the fork was Australian Craig Wright, \u2018the self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin\u2019. He is a co-founder of the BCOMM Association which aims to safeguard Bitcoin from unnecessary diversion from its original protocol. At the time of the fork, he was also Chief Scientist at nChain, a blockchain technology research and development company which later initiated the development work on Bitcoin SV. \n\n Bitcoin Cash follows the Bitcoin Cash ABC protocol and roadmap published by bitcoincash.org. Bitcoin SV follows the Bitcoin Cash SV protocol and roadmap published by nChain. According to the Bitcoin SV website, the fork was created at the request of leading BCH mining enterprise CoinGeek. The Antiguan-based mining division is owned by Calvin Ayre, the billionaire online gambling tycoon. \n\n The chief aim of Bitcoin SV is to propagate large blocks. This feature is said to require a certain centralization of miners and node operators. In December 2018, Bitcoin SV had seen up to 512 nodes (a program that fully validates transactions and blocks), with four chief miners controlling 74% of the hash rate (a measuring unit of processing power).",

It was the first example of a cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has verification based on cryptography. \n\n The term \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 can refer to the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital value) or it can refer to the technology (a distributed network that maintains the ledger of balances of the Bitcoin token). \n\n The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto.

Anyone could download the source code and run it to join the network. Satoshi continued to write the Bitcoin code until 2010 and then handed it over to the open source community.

The supply is tightly controlled by an underlying algorithm. So, like gold, there is a limited and finite supply. Unlike the currencies issued by banks and governments, Bitcoin is not vulnerable to losing its value if the centralized issuing authority breaks down. The decentralized system can continue to operate as long as there are members in the network. \n\n The managing of transactions and the issuing of Bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source, its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. It is maintained by a group of volunteer coders and run by an open network of dedicated computers spread around the world. \n\n Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining, which comprises adding transaction records (or blocks of code) to Bitcoin's public ledger (or chain) of past transactions and keeping them in the queue. Blocks are chopped off as each transaction is finalized, codes deciphered, and Bitcoins passed or exchanged. Miners use special software to solve the math problems that keep the Bitcoin process secure and are issued a certain number of Bitcoins in return.

    "description": "Bitcoin Private (BTCP) is a cryptocurrency that was created as a hard fork of Bitcoin and a simultaneous merge with ZClassic (a hard fork of ZCash) on February 28th, 2018. It combines the features of both cryptocurrencies providing its users with fast transactions and a possibility to fully hide their traces in the network. It is a fully community-driven project and it has no special team behind it. The key problem that BCTP focuses on is related to scalability. As Bitcoin\u2019s popularity grew over the years and more transactions had to be registered on the blockchain, its small block size (only 1 MB) resulted in a scalability issue. Bitcoin can only process 7 transactions per second at the maximum. So when more people try to send funds in a given moment in time, those who set higher fees get the privilege to verify their transactions faster while others have to wait. Thus, transactions get sluggish, the fees spike and the whole system loses its efficiency. With such limitations, Bitcoin can hardly be used as a usual means of payment on a daily basis. Increasing the block size is one way to resolve this issue, but since the personality Bitcoin\u2019s creator is still unknown and there is no person or company eligible to make this decision, it remains the way it is. In fact, the debates about BTC\u2019s block size have been going on in the crypto community for ages. A few projects dared to do that, and Bitcoin Private is one of them. In addition to doubling the block size (2 MB on BTCP vs only 1 MB on BTC), the project aims to resolve the problem of privacy. Although Bitcoin was initially designed to help its users stay anonymous, it is still possible to identify BTC wallet owners by gathering additional information about them on the web.  Bitcoin Private implements the features of ZClassic that relies on Equihash, the algorithm that allows to carry out transactions in an anonymous way. Also, BTCP utilizes the zk-SNARKs privacy protocol, a zero-knowledge proofs method for additional privacy and security of transactions. BTCP was issued and distributed via a standard airdrop scheme with no premine and no founders\u2019 reward. Both BTC and ZCL holders received to their wallets the amount of BTCP coins that was equal to their wallet balances at that time. The total coin supply of BTCP equals to 21 million, the same as BTC. On February 16-17th, 2018, BTCP conducted the coinburn. In the project\u2019s whitepaper, this method was suggested as a possible solution in case BTCP suffers from an extremely low network hash rate. However, in December 2018, CoinMetrics issued a report revealing that there was a large number of illegitimate BTCP coins. The team confirmed the information and burned all the coins that remained on the users\u2019 wallets during the network snapshot in order to recompense the owners of legitimate coins. Those who moved the coins to other wallets before that date managed to save their funds. In March 2019, BTCP was delisted from the cryptocurrency exchange HitBTC. The project\u2019s team accused the platform of fraud for removing the coin without any valid explanation. For that, the platform posted a response that the reason for delisting was related to their concerns about the project\u2019s security. According to HitBTC, the developers had not provided them with the code or documentation for the cryptography used in their blockchain.  The coin hasn\u2019t been placed back on HitBTC ever since. At the time of writing, BTCP is available for trading on Graviex and a few other small exchange platforms. It is supported by a number of wallets, including Electrum, Coinomi, Trezor and Ledger Nano S.",

    "description": "Bitcoin Gold (BTG) is a cryptocurrency created from a hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC).  Bitcoin Gold officially split from the original Bitcoin blockchain on October 24th, 2017. \n\nAccording to the website, the purpose of the Bitcoin Gold project is to restore the original decentralization of Bitcoin mining.  In the early days, Bitcoin (BTC) could be mined using regular computers.  That meant there were individual miners spread throughout the globe, each securing the platform.  However, as the network has grown, the only way to profitably mine BTC is to use ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).  ASICs are different from CPUs and GPUs in that they do only one thing, but they do it very well.  The use of ASICs has led to a monopolization of Bitcoin mining where a few big companies dominate.  If some of these large mining companies wanted to, they could join forces and issue a 51 percent attack where they control a majority of the network hash rate giving them the power to revise transaction history and prevent new transactions from being confirmed.  \n\nJack Liao, CEO of the Hong King-based mining company Lightning ASIC, first announced the Bitcoin Gold project in July 2017.  Bitcoin Gold changes Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to create a digital asset that doesn\u2019t require expensive, state-of-the-art hardware (ASICs) for mining.  Instead, Bitcoin Gold can be acquired using GPU (graphics processing unit) mining which makes it more accessible and theoretically, restores decentralization in the network. \n\nAs with any other hard fork, to claim Bitcoin Gold, users had to hold the original Bitcoin at the time of the fork to automatically receive an equal amount of Bitcoin Gold at the same address.  For people who held their BTC in hardware wallets, there were no issues.  However, for users who kept their BTC on exchanges, problems arose.\n\nAt the time, some of the largest crypto exchanges (including Coinbase and Kraken) announced they would not support BTG.  Coinbase wrote on their blog: \u201cInformation about this fork has been limited and there are concerns about its security and stability.  As a result, we do not believe it is safe to allow support for Bitcoin Gold at this time.\u201d  At the time of this writing, Coinbase and Kraken still do not support BTG.\n\nAfter officially launching on November 1st, 2017, community members criticized the development team after they found that 100,000 BTG coins had been pre-mined.  The dev team responded by saying that the pre-mined funds would be used to support the growth of the Bitcoin Gold ecosystem.  In addition, about five percent were set aside as a bonus for the team.\n\nIn that same month, the official Bitcoin Gold website was compromised and promoted a link to a fake BTG wallet.  Users were encouraged to share their old private keys to claim their free BTG tokens.  Before it was discovered and removed, more than $3.3 million were stolen in this scam. \n\nIn May of 2018, Bitcoin Gold was hacked by attackers who deployed a combination of a 51 percent attack as well as a double-spend attack.  This was done to defraud crypto exchanges since they accept large deposits automatically.  The fraudsters made large Bitcoin Gold deposits on exchanges, and at the same time, sent the same funds to wallets they owned. When exchanges realized the transactions were fake, it was too late. The hackers already withdrew the large BTG deposits from the exchanges and multiplied their funds.  In the end, the hijackers stole more than $18 million in BTG from multiple exchanges, including Bittrex.\n\nHoping to prevent future 51 percent attacks, in June 2018, the Bitcoin Gold project changed their proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm from \u201cEquihash\u201d to \u201cEquihash-BTG.\u201d",

    "description": "Bytom (BTM) is a cryptocurrency that is used primarily in the area of asset management.  The key goal of the project is to create a decentralized platform where various physical and digital assets can be freely registered and exchanged.  Established in China in early 2017, the Bytom blockchain is focused on building a bridge between the world of physical assets (securities, bonds, dividends, etc.) and the digital economy.\n\nThe problem that Bytom aims to resolve is related to the lack of a unified way to map assets from the physical world to their digital versions.  Moreover, for the system to work properly, both digital and physical assets should be interoperable, i.e. the flow of assets on-chain and off-chain should occur without any obstacles.  In order to overcome these problems, Bytom has developed a blockchain protocol for financial and digital asset applications to register assets in its network.\nHow does Bytom work?\nBytom allows to register 3 types of assets on-chain for further trading:\nIncome assets.  These are non-performing assets, local government investments, and crowdfunding campaigns.\nEquity assets.  This class includes equity in private companies and shares of a non-public investment.  It requires investor verification to make any transactions.\nSecuritized assets.  These assets include debts and automobile loans.  Their key feature is predictable cash flow.  \n\nRecording assets on the blockchain can be quite beneficial for their owners.  For one, it allows claiming your ownership in a much more secure and efficient way.  Also, it allows to get rid of multiple layers of intermediaries and thus helps to lower costs and speed up the whole procedure.  Asset owners no longer have to trust any third-party to keep records and can freely exchange their belongings on a peer-to-peer basis.\n\nBytom is not the only blockchain project focusing on asset tokenization as Ravencoin (RVN) is one of its key competitors.  WAX and Enjin Coin can also be considered as a part of the same league as they work on tokenizing gaming assets.\nSystem architecture\n\nThe Bytom architecture consists of three main layers: \nThe Application layer.  \nThis layer is designed specifically for end-users to facilitate their interaction with the platform.  It includes the web and the mobile app where you can manage your assets via triggering contract calls.\nThe Contract layer.\nThere are two types of contracts acting at this layer.  The Genesis Contract is designed for issuing and auditing other contracts on the network.  The General Contract facilitates the trading process between users, sets up and verifies dividend distributions.\nThe Ledger layer.\nAt this layer, Bytom connects to the blockchain and registers assets on an immutable public ledger.\nBytom token (BTM)\n\nThe Bytom network is powered by a native cryptocurrency BTM that has 3 main use cases:\nTransaction fees for asset trading\nDividends\nAsset issuance deposits\n\nThe BTM coin acts as a license to access the Bytom blockchain as BTM holders get the right to participate in the network management.  It is distributed across miners, investors, developers and reserve funds.  \n\nBytom is based on the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm and can be mined on both ASICs and GPUs.  Initially based on Ethereum\u2019s network, Bytom has launched its own mainnet on April 24th, 2018.  \n\nBTM can be stored on the Bytom official wallet that is available for download on its website and is compatible with all popular operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux).  ERC-20 wallets such as Coinomi, MyEtherWallet, and Trezor don\u2019t support Bytom after the swap.  BTM is listed on many reputable exchanges including OKEx, Huobi Global, CoinEx, and Gate.io and can also be stored on the online wallets provided by these platforms.\n\nBytom has officially passed the Howey Test which means that BTM tokens will not be classified by SEC as securities.\nBytom ICO\n\nThe ICO was conducted on the Ethereum platform.  The team managed to raise the required sum of more than 2 million USD within a month from June 20th to July 20th, 2017.  ETH was the only cryptocurrency that the project accepted.\n\nOnly 30% of tokens were distributed via public sale.  The rest was allocated for the following purposes:\n7% - private investors\n20% - Bytom Foundation reserve\n10% - business development\n33% - mining\nBytom team\n\nThe team standing behind the project includes some great specialists from the blockchain world.  \n\nBytom\u2019s founder Chang Jia has another successful project behind his shoulders, 8btc, which is one of the largest blockchain news websites in China.  His business partner Duan Xinxing was a vice president at OKCoin, a reputable cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The project\u2019s CEO Lang Yu has the technical background as prior to Bytom he worked as a Senior System Engineer at Alipay.",

    "symbol": "BTS",
    "name": "BitShares",
    "description": "Launched by a US-based cryptocurrency entrepreneur and a software programmer Daniel Larrimer in 2014, BitShares represents a decentralized platform based on blockchain technology.  The platform allows its users to switch cryptocurrencies between their own wallets without having to upload them to any centralized party.  The project was developed in response to the crisis of trust in centralized exchanges after ill-famous Mt.  Gox was hacked and thousands of users lost their bitcoins.  \n\nApart from the crypto exchange features, Bitshares offers a whole set of financial tools for businesses and all these tools are fueled by a native cryptocurrency BTS.  Known in the past as Protoshares, the platform merged several products into a single platform and received a new name Bitshares in November 2014.\n\nWhat makes Bitshares different\n\nThe key problem with all centralized cryptocurrency exchanges is that users have to entrust their digital funds to a third-party for safekeeping.  This brings down the whole point of using cryptocurrencies that were initially created with the purpose to provide users with an alternative means of payment that would be independent of centralized financial institutions.  With centralized exchanges, you have no control over your money and this puts your funds at risk.  Regardless of how old and reputable a platform is and what measures it claims to take in order to ensure funds\u2019 security, it may still fall under hackers\u2019 attack or simply go bankrupt.\n\nThings are different with Bitshares.  The platform has no access to users\u2019 funds, it simply provides them with a mechanism to exchange cryptocurrencies between their own wallets at a given rate.  With Bitshares, you are the only one responsible for the security of your assets and the only one governing the access to them.\n\nThe possibility to exchange cryptocurrencies is not the only feature provided by Bitshares.  Larrimer has invented a platform that can serve as a single entry point for any business or individual in the world of cryptocurrencies.  A network, a bank, a ledger, an exchange, a company, community, software, and currency - all this is combined under one hood of Bitshares.  In fact, the project outpaces its own time as the demand for such a platform is yet to come.\n\nIn addition to this robust functionality, Bitshares has practically unlimited scalability as it allows processing up to 100,000 transactions per second.  This has become possible thanks to the Delegated-Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and Graphene blockchain that BTS is based upon.  Compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 7 TPS and Ethereum\u2019s 19 TPS, Bitshares has proved to be much better prepared for the influx of users and capable of handling an even higher level of demand than the one experienced in 2017.  \n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and the majority of other digital assets that can only be stored on illegible an unmemorable wallet addresses, Bitshares offers its users named accounts.  This reduces the risk of making a mistake when sending funds to someone else as users don\u2019t have to fear making a typo in addresses where they send the money to.\n\nBTS use cases\n\nThe cryptocurrency BTS plays an important role in the Bitshares ecosystem.  It is not a simple cryptocurrency as it comes with a much broader set of use cases.\n\nFirst, BTS can be used in deposit receipts.  While banks and other similar payment systems such as PayPal issue deposit receipts on users\u2019 balances in a centralized manner, Bitshares moves all these databases to a decentralized blockchain.\n\nNext, BTS can be used as a basis for issuing customized assets.  Any company or an individual can issue own securities on Bitshares and distribute them among investors.  Also, it\u2019s possible to issue BTS-based stable coins with bitUSD and bitEUR as the most popular examples.  In order to issue such a stable coin, BTS should be locked up in a smart contract as collateral.\n\nBTS can be used as reward points by merchants to stimulate their customers.  Event organizers accept BTS when selling tickets and then allow users to cryptographically check-in.  Other use cases of BTS include crowdfunding, asset seizing, Know-Your-Custome procedures and many more.\n\nBTS token\n\nBitshares conducted private IPO in 2014 and there\u2019s no information available on how much money was raised for the product\u2019s development and who the investors were.\n\nBTS can be stored on a web wallet and a desktop wallet which is available for download on the project\u2019s website and is compatible with all popular operating systems.  \n\nBitshares founder\n\nThe key person standing behind Bitshares is Daniel Larrimer.  This is quite a notable persona in the world of cryptocurrencies as he is the only one to invent a blockchain-based system that would resolve the scalability issue and remain decentralized at the same time.  The idea of a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange was born in 2013.  Larrimer shared his invention with Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Charles Hoskinson who helped him develop it further.\n\nApart from Bitshares, Larrimer has two other successful projects behind his shoulders, Steemit and EOS.  Steemit is a decentralized blogging platform letting its users make money for the content they create and get rewards directly to their own wallets without having to share their earnings with any third party.  EOS is a blockchain-based platform for dApps creation with ultra-high throughput indices.  At the time of writing, it\u2019s one of the most active blockchains according to blocktivity.info.",

    "symbol": "CAKE",
    "name": "PancakeSwap",
    "description": "CAKE is a governance token issued by a decentralized exchange PancakeSwap, which is an automatic market maker also called AMM.  Many people call it a clone of Uniswap with one exception only.  It works on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is Binance own blockchain.  The facility enables the trading of BEP-20 tokens for users who can also earn rewards providing the liquidity for the exchange.  \n\nThere is a possibility of farming the governance token of the platform CAKE.  Depositing LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, customers lock their assets for rewards.  There are a lot of tokens that can be deposited for this goal such as BNB LP (Cake or BUSD), ETH LP (BETH), and others.  \n\nThe aims targeted by PancakeSwap\n\nThe team of the platform pursued several goals during the development and one of them was to overtake such decentralized projects as SushiSwap and Uniswap.  The team introduced interesting developments combining non-fungible tokens (NFT) with swaps, lending, and UI customization.  Special attention was paid to such aspects as speed, low fees, and 3-digit API.  Thanks to the efforts of developers, the token has acquired the top position in the DeFi rankings on Binance Smart Chain.  Thus, the goal has been partially achieved.  The choice of BSC above Ethereum is explained by the speed and lower fees provided by BSC which turn out to be really ponderable benefits and help to attract more users.\n\nThough the assortment of products is good, the roadmap includes the development of more services on the platform including lending and borrowing, binary options, margin trading, and NFT-based gamification.  \n\nPancakeSwap platform\n\nAt first sight, this is just another food-themed DeFi protocol that resembles SushiSwap in such features as community governance and the capability of farming liquidity provider tokens.  However, besides that, the platform introduced numerous features for the members of the community that allow them to earn higher rewards.  The funds can be staked in DeFi protocol in return for its tokens in the same way as in other DeFi projects.  Most of them are found on the Ethereum blockchain, which was the first that incorporated the support of smart contracts.  \n\nThe platform gives the possibility of trading digital assets without an order book.  It means that customers are not matched with each other trading against a liquidity pool that includes funds of other members of the community who invested in the pool.  After depositing, users get liquidity provider tokens (LP tokens) that can be used to reclaim a share with a part of the trading fees.  \nThe platform with improved UX employs an easy-to-use navigation system.  The members of the community can use a convenient personal dashboard that is customized to their taste.  It is also worth mentioning the mobile-friendliness of the service.  \n\nThe platform is actively inviting other projects to participate in the Syrup Pool.  Such projects as OpenDAO, DODO, Swinby, Berrym, Compound, ZeroSwap, and many more have contributed their tokens to the pool by the time of writing.  Users can earn the tokens of these projects in the same way by staking CAKE.\n\nThe platform arranges lottery sessions that take part every 6 hours.  The customers should purchase tickets to participate.  After its purchase, the person gets a random 4-digit combination of numbers from 1 to 14.  The winner is a user with a combination of figures that match all numbers in the same position as in the ticket.  In this case, 50% of the lottery pool is given to the winner.  \n\nPancakeSwap includes the exchange section, the pools section, and the farming section.  Customers should provide liquidity to farm the CAKE token.  It is necessary to have some Binance Coin to stake CAKE.  The farming section offers pools with different rewards.  Thus, the members of the community who provide the liquidity get 0.17% of all transaction fees and also earn FLIP tokens they can stake afterwards.\n\nPancakeSwap security\n\nBeing aware of the safety problem faced by many decentralized exchanges the company applied to a reputable expert company, which was invited to audit the code.  The CertiK\u2019s audition conducted in October 2020 added one more advantage to the list of the platform\u2019s features.\n\nPancakeSwap tokens\n\nCAKE can be staked in SYRUP pools.  There are also FLIP tokens on the platform, which are liquidity provider tokens.  They are used for farming CAKE and SYRUP tokens.  The LP tokens should be locked for you to get the reward.  However, when CAKE tokens are staked by customers, SYRUP tokens can be received, which have extended functionality and can be used as governance tokens.  They also serve as tickets in lotteries.  \n\nCAKE token\n\nThe native token is CAKE, which has grown by 6000% in only 5 months since the release date.  The growth of its price also affected the price of BNB, a native token of the Binance ecosystem.  \n\nThe burning system is rather complicated.  The issuance of CAKE tokens is rebalanced by their redistribution in the farms, in the lottery, in the pools for staking, and the Initial Farm Offering.  There are different percentages in each sector, which are sent to a blind address for burning.  The aim is to keep the balance of supply.  \n\nMany features become accessible for users after they unlock the wallet.  There are a few options offered to customers such as Trust Wallet, Binance Chain Wallet, Wallet Connect, and others.  MetaMask can also be found in the list as the BSC architecture enabled its interaction with dApps of its blockchain.\n\nPancakeSwap fees\n\nDuring the token swap on the exchange, customers pay a 0.2% trading fee, 0.03% of which is sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury, while the rest is returned to the liquidity pools to pay rewards to the liquidity providers.\n\nPancakeSwap team\n\nThe platform was developed by an anonymous team that launched the facility at the end of September 2020.  However, it is known that the project was financed by CZ Zhao, the founder, and CEO of a leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance.",

    "symbol": "COMP",
    "name": "Compound",
    "description": "COMP is an ERC-20 token that was launched on the Ethereum blockchain in 2018.  This is a coin of Compound Protocol, a money market protocol where interest rates are generated algorithmically based on supply and demand.\n\nCOMP tokens give governance over the protocol to users.  They can take part in the future of the protocol voting for initiatives and trying to improve the system.  Members can propose and vote on upgrades of the protocol.\n\nCompound is a decentralized lending platform created in September of 2018.  The company behind the platform is Compound Labs Inc., based in San Francisco.  However, the decentralized platform has become rather independent and doesn\u2019t depend on the company any longer.\n\nThe main goals of the platform are stated differently on the project\u2019s website but the main point remains the same.  The project urges cryptocurrency holders not to leave their funds idle and put them to use.  Therefore, the users of the platform can borrow and lend digital assets based on Ethereum including such coins as BAT, wBTC, and 0x (ZRX).\n\nCOMP background\n\nThe protocol token was released in June and this has become a huge milestone for the community.  The decision was taken to distribute 50% of COMP among the members of the community, while another 50% get allocated among the investors of the project and the team.  The protocol is not operated by Compound Labs any longer.\n\nCompound system\n\nThe Compound system works differently in contrast to other borrowing services with either fixed rates installed or the rates agreed between the parties.  The rates on the Compound platform are established by supply and demand, which is regulated by the sophisticated algorithm that is frequently updated.  With the growth of demand, the interest rates grow as well for better regulation of the market.  It was made not to let users over-borrow, while the lenders are motivated to lend in this way.  At this, the funds are not frozen and the borrowers have the opportunity to withdraw their assets when they wish.\n\nWhen borrowers owe more than allowed because of the collateral\u2019s price drop, users face the risk of losing the collateral as it can be liquidated.  It\u2019s possible to select this option and then acquire the collateral with a discount.  Users can pay back the part of the debt to improve the borrowing capacity and avoid the liquidation process.\n\nCompound platform\n\nIn June 2020, Compound launched the liquidity mining program to urge lenders and borrowers to use the Compound protocol.  The lack of activity would bring to decline, therefore the platform rewards the members of its community to ensure high liquidity.\n\nAt the time of writing, the platform is implementing its oracle Open Price Feed in numerous networks.  It will rely on data from posters and price reporters.  Various exchanges will report the price signed by the public key.  In the beginning, the Coinbase will be the only price reporter.  The oracle will also rely on Uniswap V2 price feed until it acquires numerous price reporters.  The developers say that they plan to get away from Uniswap support in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to build your own API to invoke Compound protocol smart contracts via HTTP requests.  The platform uses Infura as the bridge between the application and the Ethereum network.  The team tried to create an open and resilient infrastructure so that every member of the community could create their own interface and functionality for participation in Compound governance.\n\nCOMP token\n\nThough COMP is a standard ERC-20 token, it is more than that.  Being the token of the Compound protocol, it allows its holders to delegate voting rights to any address they wish.  At this, anybody can receive the delegation and participate in the Governance of the protocol without even holding COMP.  The voting system is rather sophisticated.\n\nCOMP tokens are provided to the members of the community for participation in the operations.  Each time users borrow or lend assets, they are rewarded with COMP.  As the price for the COMP token is rather high, it led to the situation when some users were able to raise their APY (annual percentage yield).  This is partly the reason for COMP's popularity.\n\nThe principle of Compound work is rather simple.  All members of the community combine their assets.  As a result, the system has the asset pools with funds available for borrowing.  There are Compound lending pools for different assets.  Those who need funds can borrow crypto assets below the value of the supplied collateral.  Different factors affect the amount they can borrow, for instance, the market cap of the collateral and its liquidity.  \n\nThe members of Compound community have to pass through KYC/AML procedure to be able to use the platform.\n\nICO and other financial details\n\nThere was no ICO to distribute the COMP token.  As it has been mentioned already, half of the token supply was allocated to the founders, investors, current and future team.  2.4 million tokens were allocated to the community and about 800 thousand tokens for community development.\n\nCOMP is distributed among users of the protocol on a daily basis via all markets supported by the platform.  There is an equal distribution between the suppliers and borrowers, i.e.  50/50.  Now the protocol belongs to the Community.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to buy COMP on Coinbase Pro, Binance, and Poloniex.  If a personal wallet is needed, the tokens can be stored on any wallet that supports Ethereum such as Exodus Wallet, Atomic Wallet, Trezor, Trust Wallet.  MetaMask can be a reliable option for a browser wallet.\n\nCompound team\n\nCompound Labs Inc.  CEO Robert Leshner said in the interview that Compound was designed as an experiment.  The company doesn\u2019t profit from the project.  The goal was to enable smooth and transparent borrowing and lending of Ethereum assets.  He admits that the project didn\u2019t have a roadmap at that time as the members of the team didn\u2019t know what to expect from the project.  In June 2020, the company admitted that their core work over protocol was done.  The distribution of tokens was the last step to take it over to the community.  The company agrees to step back to allow the community to take charge.",

Among its products are a metal visa card for storing cryptocurrencies along with fiat money, an online wallet, a card app, and a cryptocurrency exchange.  While the cryptocurrency MCO is used to pay commissions and convert digital coins between each other, CRO is the second altcoin which is used within the system.\n\nCRO is needed to pay transaction fees, create new nodes and convert cryptocurrencies.  This altcoin represents the project on cryptocurrency exchange platforms and is the key asset for investors who want to support the project.  It was created at the end of 2018 by the same team of developers that stand behind MCO.\n\nAbout 170 million CRO coins were distributed via an airdrop to MCO holders on a monthly basis.  The airdrop started on December 7th, 2018.  The amount that coin holders received via the airdrop depended on the MCO balance on their wallets.  For every 1,000 MCO coins on their wallets, users received around 5276 CRO and after that, CRO coins were locked for a year without a possibility to be sold.  \n\nInitially, the airdrop was to be conducted for 5 years, but it ceased in about a year when the project was getting closer to issuing its cards in the US and came across potential problems with local regulators.",

    "description": "Dai (DAI) is the first decentralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.  It is soft pegged to the US Dollar meaning the value of 1 Dai is roughly equivalent to $1 USD.  As an ERC20 token, anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer Dai.\n\nBecause the price of popular cryptoassets like Bitcoin and Ether are so volatile, few people are using them for everyday purchases.  That is why stablecoins were invented.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to other stable assets.  Unlike centralized stablecoins (for example Tether), the stability of Dai does not rely on a trusted third party.  Dai\u2019s price is maintained using smart contracts and external financial incentives that keepers take advantage of.  A keeper is an independent actor (usually automated), who among other things, buys Dai when the market price is below the Target Price (i.e., $1 USD) and sells Dai when the market price is higher than the Target Price in order to gain a profit.\n\nDai is created when a user takes on a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP).  By depositing collateral (e.g., ether) in an Ethereum smart contract, a portion of the value of the locked assets are paid out in Dai.  Just like holding any other cryptocurrency, Dai can be used for various purposes: trading, payments, personal savings account, etc.  To reclaim the collateral from the CDP, the user must repay the borrowed Dai along with an extra stability fee. \n\nUsers can also purchase Dai directly from a broker or exchange.\n\nDai is part of the two-token system on the Maker platform.  Dai is the stablecoin targeting a value of $1 per unit, and Maker (MKR) is the utility token used to pay fees on Dai loans.  The Maker token also enables holders to contribute to platform governance by voting on proposals like increasing or decreasing the stability fee.  Where Dai is for everyday use, Maker - which is not a stablecoin - is specifically for people who want to help govern the Maker platform. \n\nThe MakerDAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), co-founded by Rune Christiensen in 2014, is made up of the Maker platform technical infrastructure and the community of Maker token holder (i.e., voters). \n\nAs of the time of this writing, MakerDAO has raised $27 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, FBG Capital, Walden Bridge Capital, Distributed Capital Partners, Wyre Capital, and more.\n\nMakerDAO is headquartered in Santa Cruz, California and also has offices in New York, Copenhagen, and Warsaw.\n\nMaker and Dai launched together on the Ethereum blockchain in December of 2017.",

    "description": "Dash (DASH) is a cryptocurrency created and designed to guarantee privacy. Launched in 2014, it was originally released as XCoin (XCO) before changing its name to \u2018Darkcoin\u2019. It was one of the first digital currencies to feature a decentralized blockchain governance system. It rebranded again in March 2015; its new name is an amalgamation of the words \u2018digital cash\u2019. \n\n The coin was created as a result of a Bitcoin fork in an attempt to improve on efficiency, speed, and anonymity. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, claiming to be the perfect option for people who are not interested in cryptocurrency. Transactions have low fees and are much faster than Bitcoin. \n\n Dash coins are obtainable through mining, running the network as a masternode, or by exchanging them for other tokens and fiat currencies. Anyone can form a masternode if they hold 1000 Dash in collateral. If a miner is willing to perform advanced functions (such as increased privacy and instant transactions) they can earn a 45% block reward. In April 2018, Dash's market capitalization was around $4.3 billion, it was one of the top 12 cryptocurrencies and its peer-to-peer network was one of the largest in the world. \n\n The founder of Dash is crypto developer Evan Duffield who began to work in programming when he was still in high school. He has held positions at a number of tech firms including Warped AI, iAcquire, Wells Fargo, and Verizon Wireless. Evan became enthralled with crypto after reading Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper. When he realized the future importance of fintech, he went on to gain a series 65 license allowing him to become an investment advisor in the US. \n\n Dash is designed to have a total supply of 18 million coins with the circulating supply of Dash in 2018 hovering at around 7.4 million. The coin is set to reach its supply limit in the year 2300. Dash has a variable block reward which decreases at a 7.1 % rate each year. The average block mining time is 2.5 minutes on the Dash blockchain, which makes it four times faster than Bitcoin. \n\n Using a coin mixing service called CoinJoin, Dash allows you to send your funds privately by mixing it between several other transactions, making it harder to identify the specifics. For a slightly higher processing fee, it offers \u2018Instant Send\u2019 transactions (processed within 1.5 seconds). \n\n Dash also offers a shares scheme where users can allocate their coins to help incentivize masternodes, while receiving up to 8% of interest a year. This compares to traditional banks which offer around 0.8% return. \n\n Dash is listed on a large number of exchanges and it possible to exchange it for goods and services at a number of online organizations including online casinos, marketing agencies, and coffee merchants. Most sellers are based in the US and Europe. Over 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, Dash became extremely popular in Venezuela where the hyperinflation of the local currency had left locals unable to afford basic items or food.",

    "description": "Dentacoin (DCN) is a cryptocurrency developed specifically for use in the global dental industry.  As an ERC-20 token, Dentacoin utilizes the Ethereum blockchain.  By providing a set of incentivized software tools and a unique model of dental insurance (all of which use DCN), Dentacoin hopes to create a new ecosystem that shifts the focus of dentistry from \u201csick care\u201d to \u201cpreventive care.\u201d\n\nDentacoin was created by the Netherlands-based Dentacoin Foundation, which was co-founded in March 2017 by Professor Dimitar Dimitrakiev, Jeremias Grenzebach, and Philipp Grenzebach.  Before Dentacoin, Dimitrakiev was a university lecturer and spent over 27 years in the financial markets.  Jeremias was an early blockchain enthusiast and contributed code to Ethereum, Waves, ZCash, uPort, Status, imToken, and Byteball.  Philipp studied law, economics and business management.  Although the organization is called a \u201cfoundation,\u201d the corporate entity is registered as a for-profit business.\n\nThe Dentacoin ecosystem consists of Dentacare, DentaVox, Trusted Reviews, and Assurance. Dentacare is a mobile app that teaches good oral hygiene through a 3-month challenge.  Users can earn DCN from using the app.  DentaVox is a market research platform that collects patient feedback through surveys.  Users are compensated with DCN after each questionnaire is submitted.  Trusted Reviews is a platform for verified dentist reviews.  According to the website, patient identities are verified through the blockchain and are rewarded with DCN for providing honest feedback.  Assurance is a dental insurance-like program where patients pay a low monthly premium in DCN to their dentists and in return receive lifelong, prevention-focused dental care.  DCN can be used to pay for dental treatment, dental care products, or exchanged for other currencies.\n\nThe Dentacoin Foundation believes its ecosystem will benefit dentists as well.  By joining the Dentacoin Network, dentists can earn more stable basic income via Assurance, create a more loyal customer base via Trusted Reviews, and improve customer satisfaction via DentaVox.  Dentists will be able to use DCN to buy dental supplies and dental equipment from participating merchants.\n\nIn June 2017, the Dentacoin Foundation bought Dentaprime, a London-based tooth implant clinic, for 31.5 billion DCN.\n\nAt the time of this writing, there are over 90 locations worldwide participating in the global Dentacoin Network and accept DCN payments.  Dentacoin partners can be found in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Hungary, Bulgaria, Serbia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Pakistan, Fiji, India, and the United Arab Emirates. \n\nThe max supply of DCN is 8 trillion tokens, all of which have been pre-mined and will be distributed via time-locked contracts as adoption grows.\n\nThe ICO for Dentacoin occurred on October 2017, where 3% of the total supply went on public sale.  They raised approximately $2.6 million.",

    "description": "Decred (DCR) is an open-source cryptocurrency launched in February of 2016.  Decred (short for Decentralized Credit) was created by crypto-enthusiasts concerned that Bitcoin\u2019s decision-making was becoming too centralized due to the growth of Bitcoin mining pools.  Decred describes itself as \u201can autonomous digital currency\u201d with \u201ca strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development.\u201d\n\nDCR utilizes a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to ensure that a small group of users can\u2019t manipulate the flow of transactions or make sudden changes to the Decred protocol without the input of the community.  With a hybrid consensus algorithm, miners earn DCR for finding new blocks while Decred token holders can validate transactions to receive rewards as well as vote on network proposals.  \n\nThis allows token holders to have input in the progression of the project.  Users who stake their Decred tokens receive a ticket that, when randomly selected, allow the ticket holder to act as a block validator.  With Decred, 60% of the block reward goes to Proof-of-Work miners, 30% to Proof-of-Stake voters, and 10% to fund the development of the protocol.  This is unlike Bitcoin where 100% of the reward goes to the PoW miners.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the development funds are in the control of Decred Holdings Group LLC and is centralized.  However, the plan is to decentralize these funds via Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).  DAOs are governing entities whose actions are dictated by the stakeholders and operates via smart contracts.  \n\nDecrediton is the official wallet created by Decred developers.  It is a full-node desktop client which can safely store DCR.  With this wallet, users can also mine and stake their Decred coins.  Decrediton employs Simple Payment Verification (SPV) technology which only downloads full blocks containing transactions relevant to the user (i.e. transactions involving the wallet\u2019s addresses).  This is a difference of downloading tens of megabytes versus multiple gigabytes of data which reduces the initial load time for new wallets.  At the time of this writing, Decrediton is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.\n\nIn September of 2017, Decred and Litecoin (LTC) completed the first successful atomic swap.  An atomic swap is a peer-to-peer exchange of cryptoassets from one blockchain to another blockchain, without utilizing a third party service like an exchange.  Throughout the atomic swap process, both users have full control and ownership of their private keys.\n\nJust like Bitcoin, Decred has a max supply of 21 million tokens.  1.68 million (8 percent) Decred coins were pre-mined, half (4%) going to early developers who contributed to the project and the other half (4%) airdropped to distribute DCR to the wider crypto community.\nThe Decred project was founded by the Chicago-based firm, Company 0, led by Jake Yocom-Piatt (CEO).  Before forking Bitcoin to create Decred, Yocom-Piatt developed btcsuite, a software for interacting with Bitcoin using Google\u2019s programming language, Go.",

    "description": "DENT is an Ethereum-based utility token issued by a decentralized marketplace with the same name.  The company behind the platform is Dent Wireless that presents itself as the first digital and mobile operator.  The token was released with the purpose to tokenize Telco Assets for the purchase and sale of mobile sale packages.\n\nThe company DENT Wireless LTD headquartered in Hong-Kong started its activity in 2014.  Initially, its founder Tero Katajainen worked over an automated Forex market system with the embedded risk management features.  However, that work was used to establish another platform focused on the tokenization of mobile data.  The members of the DENT team criticize the complexity and fragmentation of the telco industry and try to destroy monopolistic business models established at the end of the last century.  The company offers a better solution instead, planning to introduce the eSIM technology that can potentially become a new standard for mobile data.\n\nThe platform claims that it has 26 million users from over 80 countries that share data for eSIM capable devices.  The company plans to add 20 countries more to the global pack for eSIM.\n\nThe aims targeted by the Dent project\n\nThe project is an attempt at democratization in the world of mobile data.  The platform turns mobile data into a commodity that can be exchanged with other members of the system.  The founders of the project consider SIM cards an outdated technology that should be replaced.\n\nThe goal of the platform is to create a data-sharing economy with capabilities of buying, selling, or donating mobile data.  Thus, the native token of the platform can become a worldwide currency for Mobile Data between telecom companies and the community.  With the spread of such currency, the problem of costly roaming is solved.  Also, the project plans to alleviate the purchase of mobile data for consumers and IoT devices.  \n\nDENT platform\n\nDent relies on the research revealing that in 2016, users lost almost 5 billion dollars as the plans they purchased were either unused or expired.  The platform strives to enable members of its ecosystem to share the mobile data with others instead of allowing this asset to lapse.  Using the technology developed by Dent, it becomes possible to give unused capacity to other members of the system.  \n\neSIM allows users to break the barriers of obsolete technologies and select the network to their liking.  However, destroying the established market, the company invites all its current participants to connect to the platform and to offer their services to customers.  \nThe company conducts research and development for its innovative IoT product called \u201ceSIM on a chip\u201d.  The goal is to create an open-source OS for a connected device in order to replace WLAN setup features with a new product mentioned above.  \n\nThe platform tries to create healthy competition between the service providers so that the consumers could choose a suitable plan easily without the necessity of buying extra services often included in the packages.  \n\nOn March 31, 2021, DENT Gigastore, the world\u2019s first global eSIM mobile data reseller platform was launched.  The packages sold on the platform are valid in more than 60 countries within a year.  \n\nDENT token\n\nThe token DENT is the currency for trading mobile data through the Ethereum blockchain.  The tokens and mobile data are smart contracts within the blockchain, which enabled the automation of the financial process.  The platform helps to connect telcos and users who are not separate customers any longer but a huge strong community with large consuming power.\n\nThe DENT token sale opened on July 12th, 2017, with up to 10% bonus tokens for early participation.  The ICO ended on 25th July.  As a result, the company raised 4,300,000 USD.  \n\nThe total token supply is 100,000,000,000 DENT.  70% of tokens were allocated for the pre-sale and token sale.  It was planned that the unsold tokens remain with the company and locked for further quarterly release within 6 months.  30% of tokens are distributed for salaries and user incentives.  \n\nDENT team\n\nTero Katajainen, a founder and CEO of the platform, had co-founded several startups in the past.  He studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Tampere, Finland.  Huge expertise in Forex trading systems contributed to his work over DENT.  Tero was one of the first developers who implemented direct payment systems of mobile operators to consumer apps.\n\nIn 2017, other co-founders joined the project to work over DENT products.  Mikko Linnam\u00e4ki is a co-founder, who previously founded several internet businesses including DOVECOT Oy that developed the world\u2018s most popular IMAP Server that can boast of over 4 million installations globally.\n\nAndreas Vollmer, a co-founder, used to work for TDSoftware that develops apps for such famous brands as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Deutsche Post, GLS, etc.\n\nThere were rumors about the partnership between Dent and Elon Musk's Starlink.  However, the deal wasn\u2019t officially confirmed.  The confirmed partnerships include Samsung blockchain, G+D Mobile Security, GSMA, bunq, and others. ",

Jared Tate, a programmer and entrepreneur, launched the DigiByte blockchain on January 10th, 2014.\n\nAlthough DigiByte is based on the Bitcoin protocol, a number of adjustments have been made in the code which make DigiByte unique.  For example, DigitByte allows for quicker confirmation speeds (15-second block time versus Bitcoin\u2019s 10 minute block time).  In addition, DigiByte uses five secure and advanced cryptographic mining algorithms (SHA256, Scrypt, Odocrypt, Skein & Qubit) instead of one.  Using multiple mining algorithms prevents the centralization of mining compared to single algorithm blockchains. \n\nAnother difference is DigiByte\u2019s implementation of DigiShield.  DigiShield was activated in February of 2014 and allows for the DigiByte blockchain to protect against multi-pools that mine large numbers of DigiByte at a low difficulty setting.  To achieve this, DigiShield recalculates block difficulty after each new block is mined.  This allows for a faster correction when a multi-pool mining operation begins or ceases contributing to DigiByte (rather than recalculating once every two weeks as is the case with Bitcoin).  Since first being implemented with DigiByte, DigiShield has been added into over 25 other cryptocurrency blockchains such as Dogecoin, Zcash, AuroraCoin, and others.\n\nDigiByte has never held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and is not controlled by a private company.  Committed to decentralization, the project is led by the DigiByte Foundation which is a decentralized volunteer-based community dedicated to supporting the DigiByte global blockchain through the three pillars of 1) education, 2) outreach, and 3) development.\n\nIn March of 2019, DigiAssets was announced.  DigiAssets is a scalable secondary layer secured on top of the DigiByte blockchain.  It allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity, and much more.\n\nThere are three layers to the DigiByte blockchain.  The first is the Applications layer and functions like an app store where decentralized apps (Dapps) and smart contracts can be built.  Digital assets can also be created on this layer using the DigiAssets protocol.  The second layer is called the Public Ledger layer which is what incentives the security of the DigiByte platform.  The third layer is the Global Network layer which provides communication and operating procedures for all the decentralized nodes (servers, computers, or mobile phones) connected to the DigiByte network.\n\nDigiByte is one of the first projects to implement SegWit (short for Segregated Witness) on their blockchain.  SegWit is a protocol upgrade that changes the way data is stored.\n\nAccording to the website, a total of 21 billion DigiByte will be created within 21 years (2014 - 2035).",

DigixDAO has a purpose to create a self-organizing community on the Ethereum blockchain with the token holders actively involved in making decisions about the development of the Digix Global Ecosystem.\n\nDigixDAO tokens\n\nThere are two different tokens issued by DigixDAO - DGX and DGD.  DGX cryptocurrency represents 1g of gold and can be converted into real gold at any time.  In other words, this token proves that you have a certain amount of gold stored in Singapore, where the company is located.  DGX owning and transacting cost fees.\n\nDGD is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 governance token.  It is not backed by gold, but holders of DGD can participate in the project\u2019s development.  They are encouraged to offer original ideas and proposals to build the Digix and DGX ecosystem.  So DGD token may be regarded as a kind of DigixGlobal shares.\n\nDGD holders may obtain DGX reward participating actively in the platform governance.  The total and circulating supply is 2,000,000 DGD.  Being an ERC-20 token, DGD can be stored on all Ethereum-compatible wallets such as the popular MyEtherWallet, and even hardware wallets like Ledger Nano S and Trezor for security-oriented investors.\n\nDigixDAO ICO\n\nDigixDAO started its ICO on March 29, 2016.  The team managed to raise the needed hard cap of 5,500,000 USD in ETH in only 12 hours as at that time Ether amounted to $11,88.  1,700,000 tokens were sold during the public sale which made up 85.0% of the circulating supply.  The remaining 300,000 tokens (15%) were reserved for the Digix team.  It was the first ICO on the Ethereum network, and it was a great success, which caused the interest of serious players in this market.\n\nIn November 2017, DigixGlobal raised 1,3 million USD in Venture Funding from Global Brain and Fenbushi Capital.\n\nDGD is traded on most of the huge exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, HitBTC, OKEx and many more.\n\nDigixDAO Team\n\nDigix is a project led by DigixGlobal, a legal company located in Singapore.  DigixDAO is responsible for Digix governance.  It was founded in 2014 in Singapore by Kai C.  Chng.\nThe leadership team consists of Kai C.  Chng (CEO and co-founder), Anthony Eufemio (CTO and co-founder) and Shaun Djie (COO and co-founder).\n\nKai C.  Chng\u2019s was an EMFX trader in a global investment bank before starting this project.  Anthony Eufemio studied at the University of Southern California, and Shaun Djie was also the ICO Advisor at Indorse.",

    "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is a blockchain-based peer-to-peer cryptocurrency which was created in December 2013, as a tongue-in-cheek riposte to Bitcoin, and the crypto world generally. Its branding featured a likeness of a Shiba Inu dog from a \u2018Doge\u2019 meme that was popular at the time. By January 2014, it had quickly and unexpectedly generated a large community following and had reached a market capitalization of $60 million. \n\n The idea for Dogecoin was conceived by Jackson Palmer, a marketer at Adobe Systems in Sydney, who tweeted a joke concept combining two of the internet's most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. Billy Markus, a Portland, Oregon-based gaming geek and IBM software developer, made the concept a reality. According to Markus, it took him about three hours to create Dogecoin. \n\n Markus based Dogecoin on an existing cryptocurrency, Luckycoin, which features a randomized reward that is received for mining a block, although this was later changed to a static block reward in March 2014. In turn, Luckycoin is based on Litecoin, which also uses scrypt technology in its proof-of-work algorithm. He simply changed a few core elements, including replacing the word \u2018mine\u2019 with \u2018dig\u2019 (because that\u2019s what dogs do). \n\n Markus went live with Dogecoin in his lunch break and within five minutes of launching no longer had enough computer power to dig the currency himself. Its coin supply of 100 billion was set to ensure that each DOGE would remain reasonably priced, and also because it was easier to dig them up. Markus split what he'd mined 50-50 with Palmer. They each earned  $5,000 from the entire project. \n\n As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been dug up, while Bitcoin's final coin will be mined in 2140. An additional 5.256 billion DOGE are created every year and the supply is said to be infinite. \n\n One significant benefit of DOGE is that miners need only a minute to confirm a transaction, substantially less time than Bitcoin or Litecoin. Additionally, the Dogecoin system has no cap on the number of DOGE that users can dig up. As long as diggers continue operating, the DOGE supply will continue to expand. \n\n Dogecoin\u2019s low transaction fees quickly made it a conduit for traders looking to convert their Bitcoin into cash without having to pay Bitcoin\u2019s steep transaction fees. At several points in the last few years it was one of the top three actively traded cryptocurrencies, and in 2018 had a market cap of $2 billion, despite not having a software update since 2015. \n\n Dogecoin is known for its sustainable and friendly community, which offers assistance to members that are in trouble or have suffered hacks, and donates to interesting charitable causes. Some examples of charitable donations include earmarking $50,000 for the Jamaican bobsled team to go to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and a $30,000 contribution towards the construction of a well in the Tana River basin in Kenya. \n\n Dogecoin is commonly used for tipping. Users tip other users for posts or contributions on platforms that they believe deserve recognition. The tipping process is available on some popular social platforms through third-party apps. It\u2019s similar to a Facebook \u2018like\u2019 but with more impact. \n\n Jackson, Dogecoin\u2019s main spokesman, became disillusioned with the growing number of crypto scams and the emergence of institutional trading, which he believed was a step away from crypto\u2019s original ethos. He left the company in 2015 without making a dime from his hobby project, handing over the development of Dogecoin over to trusted community members. Billy has led a less public life and goes by the pseudonym of Shibetoshi Nakamoto on Twitter.",

    "description": "Polkadot is a decentralized exchange platform that was created in 2016 by the Web3 Foundation, a Swiss non-profit organization that is based in Switzerland\u2019s Crypto Valley.  The network was developed by the Parity Technologies project with Dr.  Gavin Wood at its head.\nThe Polkadot project is one of the most high-profile ICOs in history.  It managed to raise almost 145 million USD in a fundraising round in October 2017 or about 500,000 ETH at the time of fundraising.  It was necessary to pass through a strict verification procedure to invest in the project.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting the interoperability and scalability of the project making it so successful.  The unlimited growth of the system becomes possible thanks to the use of parachains.  The Polkadot network allows blockchains with different consensus models to interact with each other through dedicated intermediaries, without any action required from the developers or users of these blockchains.\n\nThe goals of the Polkadot project\n\nThe main goal of the project is to create a platform that allows different blockchains to interact with each other, but the project developers do not intend to stop there.  The vision of the project is to create a fully decentralized Internet 3.0 based on Web3.\n\nThe system will also allow uniting public and private networks and databases, as well as all other technologies that will find the application on the new Internet.  Moreover, the platform with almost unlimited scalability allows an unlimited number of blockchains and services to be connected to it.\n\nIn fact, the project takes on the issue of the security of blockchains, services, and applications, allowing their developers not to think about the technical issues at all and focus on other tasks.\n\nPolkadot platform and technology\n\nThe project pursues extremely ambitious goals and  its implementation was very difficult.  The first block of Polkadot's own network appeared in the third quarter of 2019, that is, three years after the work on the project started.\n\nThe startup has created a protocol for the combination of various third-party blockchains and decentralized databases.  Thus, Polkadot has created a cross-chain ecosystem in which many different blockchains can exchange data with each other, including transactions.  The Polkadot system itself acts as a connecting glue for control, interoperability, and scalability.  The Relay Chain is the Core Polkadot blockchain, and other blockchains that are called parachains are connected to it with help of Substrate.\n\nThe open-source protocol enables anyone to make sure of its reliability, as well as help in finding and fixing bugs.  The successful functioning of the project and its ecosystem directly depends on its participants.  Several main categories of users are responsible for the system's performance.  One of them is validators, who validate the data contained in the parachain blocks.  They receive project tokens for data verification.  In addition, they add new blocks to the relay chain (the mechanism responsible for maintaining consensus and exchanging transactions between different blockchains).  These blocks are then moved to all available parachains, due to which the exchange of transactions between blockchains is achieved.  For each transaction, validators should make a deposit.  If the transaction meets the consensus requirements, the collateral is returned and the validator receives a reward.  If the consensus is violated, the collateral disappears.\n\nNominators are the other necessary component of the system.  Their main task is to select reliable validators, ensuring the protection of the relay chain.  They need to select only those who comply with the requirements of consensus since the nominators pay a deposit for them.  They are not involved in the process of making and confirming transactions.\n\nCollators belong to the fundamental link of the system.  They perform the function of managing parachains (parallel blockchains) collecting user transactions and confirming blocks based on the proof of validity algorithm (proof of validity).  They receive the award for their work in the form of 100% commissions.  Their activity can be compared to the work of blockchain miners with more standard algorithms such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.\n\nThe category of fishermen is responsible for tracking violations made by validators.  Despite the fact that they are not doing anything else, they get a high reward for identifying violations.  They also need to make a deposit to participate in the process.\n\nDOT token\n\nDuring the ICO, 5 million tokens were sold, and a total of 10 million were issued.  The DOT token has three main purposes.  It was created for control over the ecosystem, execution of transactions, and communication.  Tokens are needed to add new parachains, to bind tokens, to remove old and unnecessary ones, and to remove bound tokens.  This is a form of a proof-of-stake algorithm.\n\nAll network participants, from collators to ordinary users, can receive rewards for actions that contribute to the development of the network.  Penalties are provided for actions that do not comply with consensus algorithms.  This system should ensure the reliable functioning of Polkadot.\n\nAs it has already been mentioned above, the Polkadot project raised 144.3 million USD in a fundraising round in October 2017.  It happened a month before a successful hacking attack.  The investors highly assessed an interesting, well-thought-out idea of the project.  Unfortunately, most of these funds will never be available to the project.  In 2019, 500,000 DOT tokens, which is 5% of the total supply, were sold turning Prolkadot into a unicorn project with evaluation over 1.2 billion USD.\n\nPolkadot team\n\nDr.  Gavin Wood Parity, who co-founded Web3 and Parity Technology projects, is also a co-founder of Ethereum.  He has a PhD in Software Engineering.  However, it is worth noting that Wood's reputation is not that spotless.  In 2017, the Parity Technology's Ethereum wallet was attacked by hackers in 2017 due to the vulnerability in the code and the company lost 153,000 ETH.  After some time, the same vulnerability was used again.  At that time 513,000 ETH were frozen forever.  The most interesting thing is that the startup Polkadot suffered the most, having lost at least 306,000 ETH due to the freeze.",

In 2018, they launched the eBoost wallet and the Alaris gaming platform.  According to the website, eBoost has a peer-to-peer community within the esports ecosystem with over 50,000 gamers using their platforms daily.  The biggest platform is Tradecentral, a game items trading platform on Discord where eBoost is the main medium of exchange. \n\nMarshall Long and Nicholas Thomas, both early adopters of Bitcoin, are the cofounders of eBoost.  Jim Blasko, long-time blockchain developer and pioneer, led the development team until November 2018. \n\neBoost was created as a non-mineable coin. According to Long, \u201cNon-mineable was the approach because all of our token supply is fully transparent.\u201d As of the time of this writing, EBST is available on the following exchanges: BOAexchange, RightBTC, TradeSatoshi, and ChangeNOW. \n\nIn March of 2018, eBoost wallets added a staking feature that allowed users to earn a dividend by staking their tokens. After 30 days, the wallet owners earned a certain percentage based on how much EBST they staked. \n\nIn July of 2018, the now-defunct Octaex Exchange shut down shortly after participants sent eBoost tokens for an airdrop. With the exchange no longer in operation, it was impossible for participants to withdraw their funds. In response, eBoost refunded the token holders who lost their eBoost coins. After verifying submissions, eBoost distributed a total of 1.7 million EBST tokens to refund its community.\n\nOn July 25th, 2019, eBoost announced Raul Jimenez as the new CEO, replacing Nicholas Thomas.

Solving these problems, the team of the company is developing a decentralized network.  The system is designed to become an instrument of value transfer for IoT and contemporary digital technology.  The company tries to bring up the performance levels of a decentralized network to make the platform compete with its centralized analogies equally.\n\nElrond Network\n\nValidators are incentivized to provide security to the system by locking ERD in the stake, processing transactions, running a node, producing blocks, and reaching consensus.  The contribution of validators is rewarded.  Those who can\u2019t run a validator\u2019s node can still earn rewards by locking ERD in a smart contract.\n\nThe team always tries to improve its protocol trying to solve its imperfections and ensure that it is robust.  It is easy to use the system, as it was one of the priorities when the platform was developed.  The user-oriented approach was applied to help users adapt even if they never dealt with blockchain before.  Security is also the primary priority for the company.  The platform protected efficiently, utilizing pBFT and SPoS consensus mechanisms thus preventing Sybil and DDoS attacks.  \n\nElrond Virtual Machine was implemented for the Elrond Network to enable unlimited communication between different external services.  The system is highly efficient for those who want to minimize energy and computational requirements utilizing network services.  A combination of decentralization with cross-chain interoperability creates unique possibilities for users.  Full decentralization delivered by the company also helps to minimize the risk of exploitation of a single point of failure.\n\nElrond technologies\n\nThe Elrond Network has created a new blockchain architecture from scratch that is suitable for solving scalability problems with the help of Adaptive State Sharding and an innovative Secure Proof-of-Stake (SPoS) consensus mechanism.   \n\nConsidering the architecture of the platform it\u2019s important to point out its main components.  These are nodes and users, which are the two key entities of the network, validators, who handle consensus building and block generation, shards that validators are assigned to, and ERD tokens, which are the gateway for gaining access to the Elrond Network.\n\nThe virtual machine has proven to be the fastest in comparison with the platform\u2019s competitors.  Speed is the main differentiating factor that makes the resource stand out from its competitors.  The platform is endlessly scalable thanks to its technologies.  Each shard adds 3,000 more transactions per second, so the more nodes join the network, the more transaction volume the platform can handle.\n\nUse of the Secure Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism delivers eligibility via stake and rating.  Random selection of validators on the first stage is followed by verification of a new block and then the transaction is processed.  The platform also uses such technologies as pBFT consensus mentioned above already.\n\nERD token\n\nThe company has issued ERD token, the total supply of which is 20 billion ERD.  The pre-staking process included 10 successful ways with the final wave unfolded at the beginning of 2020.  The goal was to accept 5 billion ERD.  The company promised the reward rate between 17% and 32% annually.\n\nBeing a utility token, ERD token is used as a payment method and a reward for validators.  It is also required for voting in a decentralized governance system.  There are low transaction costs on the exchange thanks to the use of upgraded PoS consensus.\n\nElrond team\n\nThe company Elrond Ltd. is registered in Malta, but most of the team members work from Romania.  The team includes about 20 members with different backgrounds in multiple startups and international corporations.  The company also uses the services of 7 advisors.  \n\nThe leadership team is highly professional.  The co-founder and CEO Benjamin Mincu was previously the CEO of ICO Market Data and Metachain Capital and also a member of the NEM Foundation.   \n\nAnother co-founder of the company is Lucian Todea who takes the position of COO in the Elrond company.  Being an experienced investor and entrepreneur, he is also the CEO of Soft 32, the company founded by him.  This is an online software platform that makes the distribution of apps easier.  One more co-founder of the exchange is Lucian Mincu, CIO, who also was the co-founder of ICO Market Data and Metachain Capital.  He specializes in infrastructure engineering.\n\nAlso, the key figures of the company include Adrian Dobrita, Head of Engineering, who developed software for Samsung, Intel, Continental, etc.  and Felix Crisan, Head of the Research, who is also the CTO and the co-founder of Netopia, a mobile solutions provider.  Previously, he worked for IBM and Hewlett Packard.  Felix was a co-founder of the first Bitcoin exchange platform in Romania.\n\nThe team of advisors includes rather famous personalities in the world of cryptocurrencies such as Alex Iskold, Managing Partner at 2048 Ventures, and Technical advisor Fabio C. Canesin, who co-founded City of Zion and NEX.\n\nAs for cooperation with other companies, the platform works with Netopia, a payment provider, and Nash, known as NEX, which is a decentralized finance platform.  Also, a notable partnership developed with the integration of ERD tokens on Samsung\u2019s blockchain wallet.  The integration with fiat-to-crypto services provider MoonPay enabled direct access to ERD with Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Visa, Mastercard as well as other payment processors and bank transfers.",

    "description": "The project aims to create a new Internet based on blockchain technology.  In this new Internet, among other things, people will be able to own digital assets and receive income from them.\n\nElastos\u2019s goal is to make digital assets scarce and exclusive so that they could be bought and sold seamlessly by their owners on the web.  Property rights are well worth it, and Elastos intends to build a new World Wide Web that respects them.\n \nDespite the fact that the development of the Elastos concept was carried out in 2000 by Rong Chen, the modern version combined with blockchain technology began to be developed only in 2017.  Nowadays Elastos tokens can be bought for BTC and ETH on Huobi exchange.\n \nThe issues that Elastos aims to resolve\n \nThe main goal of Elastos developers is to create a platform where it will be possible to obtain ownership of digital assets such as games, films and audio works.  Users will be able to use Elastos to authenticate virtual rights, transfer smart contracts and turn digital data into specialized assets through blockchain technology.  \n \nThe Elastos network also helps to store important information about data posed on the Internet and about the use of special products with protection against falsification.  Elastos uses the Internet as the base platform on which the work process is built and separates network communications from application computing.\n\nWith Elasots, applications for direct access to the network are restricted as a measure against cyber attacks.  Optimization of energy efficiency is achieved through mining merger with Bitcoin which also helps Elastos\u2019 applications to leverage the security of the Bitcoin network.  What's more, side chains are implemented for double safety.  Elastos network utilizes the highest level of security standards to prevent hackers from stealing someone else\u2019s data or launching an attack.  This is facilitated by an open-source implementation for virtual machines.\n\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bElastos originates from Ron Chen, a former senior software engineer at Microsoft.  Based on his experience, he seeks to create a platform with direct access to the network.  He introduces the new technology of Elastos Smart Web in 2017.\n \nThe Elastos network\n \nElastos network consists of 4 core elements.  It includes smart contracts, Elastos carrier where decentralized applications will be developed, Elastos runtime where is the control of the implementation of smart contracts and Elastos SDK through which it will be possible to authenticate users and create digital signatures.\n \nElastos tokens\n \nThere is an official wallet for storing Elastos coins ELA, the client software which is available for download on the platform\u2019s official website.\nThe Elastos blockchain uses joint mining with Bitcoin, a process in which consensus is reached on both chains simultaneously.  In this system, Bitcoin is a kind of parent blockchain for Elastos while the chain of the latter acts as an auxiliary one.  The pools will find a solution to prove working on both chains at the same time and the cost of energy and computing power will not increase.  It is noteworthy that the Elastos sidechains can also participate in mining if they use PoW consensus forming stronger trust relationships in the network.\n \nElastos team and partners\n\nThe company is headed by three co-founders Rong Chen, Feng Han, and Ben Lee.\nWork at Elastos is divided into various sections with some employees being involved in the work of different departments.  More teams will be created in the future to work more efficiently.  Each department includes highly skilled workers as each team is responsible only for its direction.\n\nFor example, Elastos blockchain team led by Shunan Yu includes 28 engineers at the time of writing whose purpose is to develop Elastos main chain, sidechains, cross-chain and also an asset transfer.\n\nElastos has managed to set up partnerships with reputable companies.  One of them is Foxconn, a world leader in the manufacture of electronics components, among others the manufacturer of Apple equipment.  It is one of the ten largest companies in the world with a staff of more than 1 million people.  Foxconn invested in R&D Elastos 31 million USD.  \nAnother big partner of Elastos is SAIC Motor, China's largest automaker, which uses its blockchain technology to develop autonomous driving and smart cars.  Their market value is estimated to reach trillions of dollars by 2025.",

    "description": "Aelf is a blockchain-based operating system.  It was designed to solve the acute problems of the blockchain industry such as scalability with the help of smart contract execution via side chains and the delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.  Aelf presents itself as a decentralized cloud computing blockchain network targeting the commercial adoption of blockchain.\n\nThe Singapore-based company Aelf was launched in December 2017 without any ICO.  The project was financed by private investors only.  The private process placement was completed ahead of time on 10 December 2017 and gathered over 600% of the initial fundraising target.  Almost simultaneously (2 days later after completion of the private sale), ELF tokens were released on Binance, OKEX, BCEX, Huobi.pro, CEX, and BIBOX exchanges.  \n\nThe goals of the project\n\nThe biggest challenge facing commercial-scale adoption of blockchain is the lack of capability to meet the demands of numerous, versatile and complicated business scenarios.  Implementation of new technology entails multiple problems that need to be resolved.  A big number of dApps can\u2019t function on current operating systems and blockchain doesn\u2019t have a consensus protocol for the integration of new technology.  Aelf offers its own solution to the scalability problem providing side chains, while the Delegated Proof-of-Stake algorithm becomes a solution to the consensus problem.\n\nThe system developed by Aelf can be applied in the financial sphere, the Internet of Things, insurance and many other areas to alleviate business processes.  The main goal is to make the crypto industry more customizable and efficient for mainstream usage.\n\nThe Aelf platform\n\nThe ecosystem relies upon a self-evolving authority obtained via the voting protocol.  The community makes all decisions together playing a decisive role in the system.  For instance, they can decide upon such questions as size and speed of side chains, their removal, addition and their status that can be either public or private.\n\nAelf blockchain is the main network while other businesses can develop their dApps on sidechains with no possibility to run on the mainchain.  Users can develop their own custom blockchains with their own privacy settings and updates meaning that these modified blockchains can be entirely under their control.  Apart from customization benefits provided by side-chains, such architecture also helps to decrease data complexity.\n\nThe platform has a reward system called Candy.  Users can earn points using the Candy rewards system and fulfilling different simple tasks.  It can be a type of promotion job such as to reply to Aelf tweets, for instance, or sending invitations to people to the Telegram channel.  These actions are rewarded if the participants are members of the Candy program.  The person should sign up to become the one.\n\nThe Aelf technology\n\nThe platform employs the Delegated Proof-Of-Stake consensus system and sidechains for a unique and adaptable governance system.  It functions efficiently to obtain and optimize a multi-chain system with parallel processing and cross-chain interaction.\n\nThe users have to pay fees with Aelf native tokens (ELF) to initiate smart contracts, for transactions and money transfers.  The Aelf platform features such characteristics as nodes\u2019 scalability, parallel processing for efficient use of processing power, isolation of smart contracts with the help of side chains, interoperability and performance on different consensus protocols (dPos, PoW, PoS) using private/public chains.\n\nThe infrastructure of the Aelf platform features the main chain that has many side chains attached.  The location of side chains is recorded on the main chain.  The interaction between the side chains is performed through the main chain also, while Merkle Tree hashing is used for verification of the path.\n\nEmploying the science of cloud computing with an interconnected network of numerous cryptocurrency networks connected in side-chains with a modified set of rules, it\u2019s possible to attain their smooth interaction.  Although additional chains with exclusive rules for individual groups are formed, there\u2019s a common rule applied to all participants of the ecosystem and binding the entire ecosystem together.\n\nThe Aelf token\n\nThe Aelf token (ELF) fuels the work of the ecosystem and can be used in a number of different ways due to the variety of side-chains or protocols.  This diversity will increase with the growth of the crypto network.  This cryptocurrency is rather popular among altcoins.  It is ranked among the first one hundred coins on Coinmarketcap and traded on more than 25 exchanges such as OKEx, Kucoin, Binance, and Huobi.  It is paired with Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether.  \n\nThe total supply equals to 250 million ELF.  When a token sale for private investors was arranged in December 2017, 25% of the total supply was distributed (1,000,000,000 tokens).  The remaining tokens were distributed in the following way: 25% to Aelf Foundation with a 3-year vesting period, 16% is given to the Aelf team with 2-year vesting period, 12% is allocated for marketing goals with 3-year period, 12% is distributed to miners for 100-year period and the last 10% is given to the advisors and partnerships with 2-year vesting period.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to store ELF on hardware, online, desktop wallets or on exchanges.  The safest variant is to choose the hardware wallet, for instance, Ledger Nano S, but those who prefer a wallet for easy and fast transfer should select an online web or mobile wallet.  Any wallet with ERC-20 support such as MyEtherWallet and Exodus is suitable as ELF is an ERC-20 token.\n\nThe Aelf team\n\nThe project is developed by Ma Haobo, a former Hoopox CEO.  Aelf is supported by influential personalities in the sphere of technology and blockchain, for instance, Liam Robertson, CEO of Alphabit, and J. Michael Arrington, the founder, and CEO of TechCrunch, who act as the advisors of the company.\n\nAelf has also entered the partnership with ThetaToken in January 2018.  A month later, in February, it announced its partnership with DATX.",

    "name": "Enigma",
    "description": "Enigma is a peer-to-peer network that provides its users with the capability to use private and sensitive data in decentralized apps and services.  The project has introduced \u201csecret contracts\u201d enabling different parties to store and run computations on data to keep it secure.\n\nThe blockchain project was launched on August 14, 2015, by Enigma MPC Inc.  headquartered in San Francisco, California.  It is headed by a pair of bitcoin entrepreneurs and researchers from MIT Media Lab.  On that day, they revealed a prototype for a system called Enigma.  The team has developed a much-needed solution solving the problem of scalability and providing data privacy for its members.\n\nIn terms of privacy, the project stands apart from others not only because it\u2019s the first project of this kind.  If you look at contenders such as Verge or Dash, you\u2019ll see that they are mostly focused on transaction privacy, while Enigma\u2019s focus is on computational and data privacy.  Enigma is different because it develops a broader solution for any kind of computation.\n\nThe goal of the project\n\nThe developers of Enigma understand that data is never safe until humans have access to it.  Just remember numerous hackers\u2019 attacks spoiling the reputation of huge corporations such as LinkedIn hack in 2012, Ashley Madison data breach in 2015, Equifax cybersecurity incident in 2017, and Yahoo! data breaches in 2013, 2014.  The companies store end users\u2019 data, but responsibilities for protecting it have been placed on individuals.  However, people are ill-equipped for the tasks of this kind.  Enigma steps forward to do that for them using its unique model based on a highly optimized version of secure multi-party computation, and a modified distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data.\n\nAnother goal pursued is to get rid of the negative effects of centralization thus making governance more efficient.  Currently, much data is controlled by huge corporations.  The lack of transparency leads to disastrous data breaches, surveillance, and manipulations.  Blockchain and decentralized architecture bring a new system to society.  No party receives absolute power and control as the system has public nature that guarantees transparency giving strong incentives to remain honest.  With Enigma, users are more willing to share their data in a secure environment enabling protocol that works by encrypting smart contract data and sending it to the nodes, where computations are performed.  The data is distributed between multiple nodes, which have access to a piece of encrypted data making it secure.  \n\nEnigma technology\n\nThe computational model of the platform includes secure multi-party computational processes fulfilled by different nodes of the network.  A modified distributed hash-table is used to store data, while the external network controls the operations and manages access control, identities, serving as a tamper prooflog of events.  Security deposits are needed for the correct work of the system.  Just like in the Bitcoin system, there is no need for a third party.  The personal data is controlled in an autonomous manner.  Data sharing is entirely private which is guaranteed by cryptography.  Every time a user requests a computation from the Enigma network, a fee is required.\n\nWith Enigma, the data is encrypted before it is shared with the third party.  It\u2019s used in computations without being decrypted allowing untrusted computers to run computations on sensitive data without risk of hackers\u2019 intrusion as the actual data is never revealed.  This helps to resolve the problem of data security which is rather acute nowadays as users often share sensitive information via centralized cloud services.\n\nEnigma mimics the features of Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized networking architecture.  The data is encrypted after being split up into pieces and then distributed randomly to numerous computers within the network which are called \u201cnodes\u201d.  The nodes perform computation in the same way that computers do.  The metadata helps to identify the data that is stored in the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEnigma team was the first to prove that it\u2019s possible to use and maintain data without holding it.  Also, the team launched the project Catalyst a platform that enables anyone to start their own crypto hedge fund and make cross-chain transfers without applying to a third party.  Catalyst provides a marketplace for the exchange of data and tokens to alleviate trading.  \n\nEnigma\u2019s ICO\n\nEnigma conducted the initial coin offering on September 11, 2017, having raised 45 million US dollars.  The fixed supply of 150 million ENG tokens is distributed in the following way: 75 million tokens are distributed via a token sale (including pre-sale for the key investors), 37.5 million tokens are allocated for community incentives (data licensing, trading competitions and so on), 37.5 million tokens are retained by the Enigma team.  The team planned to burn the unsold tokens but the hard cap was attained within a few hours.  The Enigma community includes now tens of thousands of supporters.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to buy ENG tokens on such reputable platforms as Binance, Bittrex, and Huobi.  Since ENG is still an ERC-20 token, it can be stored on MyEtherWallet, Metamask, and any other ERC-20 wallet.  ENG is paired with ERC-20 tokens as long as the testnet functions.  The team doesn\u2019t specify the date when the mainnet will be launched as it leads to speculation cycles.\n\nEnigma\u2019s team and partners\n\nGuy Zyskind and Oz Nathan are the key personas standing behind the platform.  Both have graduated from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).  The system was developed under the advisement of MIT Professor and data scientist Alex \u201cSandy\u201d Pentland.\n\nGuy Zyskind became the co-founder and CEO of Enigma.  He is a pioneer in blockchain education and a software developer.  He also was a teacher in the first-ever conducted blockchain class at MIT.  Many of the other team members are also MIT graduates.\nAnother key figure in the company is the co-founder and CPO of Enigma Can Kisagun, the former founder of the company Eximchain.  Prior to launching the new project, he also worked at such an industry giant as McKinsey & Company.\n\nThe Director of Engineering is Victor Grau Serrat, former co-director of the Development Lab at MIT with huge experience in software development.  Tor Bair holds the position of the Head of Growth and Marketing at Enigma.  He was a data scientist at Snapchat and Spotify, and also worked as a derivatives trader.\n\nAs for the key partners, Enigma has managed to set up a prospective collaboration with a few other prominent projects in the blockchain industry such as KyberNetwork (KNC) and EtherDelta.",

    "description": "Enjin Coin (ENJ) is a cryptocurrency based on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard.  It is used primarily on the blockchain gaming platform with the same name for tokenizing in-game items and as a means of value exchange between players.    Enjin is a Singapore-based company that has been running its business in the gaming industry ever since 2009.  It has one of the biggest gaming platforms with the support of over 250,000 gaming communities and 20 million registered players.  In 2017, the company decided to switch its business to the blockchain rails in order to provide its users with such benefits as increased data security and irreversible transactions.  Enjin\u2019s platform allows its users to tokenize in-game assets.  Gamers exchange virtual goods on the blockchain using the ENJ coin to conduct transactions.  The transparency provided by the blockchain allows gamers to easily verify the ownership of certain assets.  Also, the platform offers an effective solution to deal with fraud and prevents users from losing their belongings due to malevolent actions.  ENJ can be used across different games and communities eliminating the barriers between the participants.  Apart from ERC-20 tokens, the platform supports ERC-1155 smart contracts that can be both fungible and non-fungible helping users claim their ownership of unique gaming items.  In addition to the gaming platform, Enjin has developed a robust solution to help developers create their own blockchain-based games.  It utilizes different types of smart contracts such as Smart Wallet Contract, Subscription Contract, the Mint, Payment Gateway Contract and TopList contract to help users cooperate directly without having to rely on a third-party to govern their deals.  Developers can create their own coins backed by ENJ to fuel their projects.  Also, Enjin offers its own SDK with a decentralized payment gateway helping developers create customized carts, refund plans, and invoices.  The Enjin project is neither the first nor the only one in the gaming industry to implement the blockchain technologies.  GameCredits and Worldwide Asset eXchange (WAX) have a similar offer, but Enjin already has some solid achievements that can help it win over.  In March 2019, Enjin set up a partnership with Samsung to integrate its technologies into South Korean Galaxy S10 models.  This piece of news was highly discussed in the media and made the ENJ coin\u2019s price skyrocket.  Also, Enjin has set up relations with such companies as Unity, PC Gamer, Arena Match, NRG eSports and a few others which can become a good contribution into the project\u2019s success.  Enjin has a multi-national well-knit team standing behind it with proven experience in software engineering, business operations, and blockchain technologies.  Its CEO and Creative Director Maxim Blagov has been working on the project ever since its launch.  He has received a Computer Science degree at the University of Technology in Sydney.  Enjin\u2019s CTO Witek Radomski has been helping Maxim grow the project ever since the foundation.  The decision to implement the blockchain technologies was made in 2017 when cryptocurrencies and ICOs were on the rise.  Enjin conducted its ICO in October 2017 and raised 12 million USD.  40% of tokens were distributed via Private Sale and the same amount was given away during a Public Sale soon after that with the remaining 20% staying in a reserve.  Half of the raised amount was invested in the product\u2019s development and 30% - into marketing and growth.  The remaining sum was equally distributed for other needs such as security, hosting, legal support and contingency.  ENJ token is traded on many different exchange platforms including Binance, Bithumb, Bittrex, and HitBTC.  It can be stored on all ERC-20 compatible wallets such as Metamask and MyEtherWallet.  Hardware wallets Trezor and Anchos support it, too.  The official Enjin Wallet which is one of the project\u2019s key viable products allows storing ENJ on Android and iOS-based mobile devices.",

The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and is capable of conducting millions of transactions per second. \n\n EOSIO was developed by the private company block.one, which is registered in the Cayman Islands. Its first whitepaper was published in 2017, and its open-source software was released on June 1, 2018. It aims to be the first decentralized operating system that provides a development environment for decentralized applications (dApps) like BitShares, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX), and Steemit, a social network with monetary incentives. \n\n The EOS utility token is supported by wallets and exchanges that support the ERC-20 protocol (a series of functions and events that an Ethereum token contract has to implement). The blockchain platform\u2019s constitution states that any EOSIO members who don\u2019t use their EOS for three years could have their accounts terminated. Block.one says this measure is to encourage the platform to be used for its intended utility i.e. building dApps and communities by staking tokens for RAM, CPU, Network, and eventually storage. \n\n Block.one\u2019s software uses a decentralized consensus algorithm called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS). It was created by block.one\u2019s co-founder Dan Larimer as an improvement to Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018Proof of Work\u2019 system. DPOS uses less electricity, is faster, and is less centralized. \n\n Dan was formerly a software engineer on America\u2019s military-industrial complex working on defense projects such as drones and unmanned vehicles. After a crisis of conscience, he left to create systems that provide \u2018life, liberty, and property for mankind.\u2019 EOSIO is the third blockchain platform he has co-founded. Larimer developed the blockchain technology Graphene, and founded Steemit, a social network which uses blockchain technology to reward users. DPOS also has a number of applications and has been used in everything from Steem (the blockchain used by Steemit), EOS, List, Ark, and more. \n\n Fellow co-founder Brendan Blumer began his journey into virtual assets aged 14, selling characters, magic weapons, and houses in online games such as Everquest and World of Warcraft. His first company, Gamecliff, created when he was fresh out of college, was acquired by Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE) in 2005. Two years later he founded The Accounts Network, a company that sold in-game MMORPG avatars. In 2010, Blumer further launched Okay.com, an enterprise data sharing platform for real estate brokers in Asia. \n\n In June 2017, EOSIO opened its initial coin offering (ICO), raising a record $4.1 billion in just one year making it the most successfully recorded ICO at the time. During this period, 1,000,000,000 EOS was distributed with 10% being withheld by block.one. \n\n In 2018 block.one announced a partnership with blockchain veterans Michael Cao and Winnie Liu to form a new $200 million joint venture fund, EOS Global. The fund will make strategic investments in Asia-focused projects that utilize EOSIO. \n\n In the same year, the company announced a number of other strategic partnerships including a $100 million joint venture fund with FINLAB AG, to support projects that stimulate EOSIO innovation in Europe. It also partnered with Galaxy Digital to deploy capital for future investments through it's $325 million EOSIO Ecosystem Fund and created a $50 million fund with TOMORROW BLOCKCHAIN OPPORTUNITIES.",

    "description": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a second generation blockchain, a network, a community, and a cryptocurrency. In addition to allowing people to send amounts of value to each other, ETC allows for complex contracts that operate autonomously and cannot be modified or censored. \n\n Both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum (ETH) have a value token called \u2018Ether\u2019, which can be transferred between participants, stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed on the Ethereum Platform. \n\n The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014, with the Ethereum system going live on 30 July 2015. \n\n Two years after Ethereum\u2019s launch there was a hack which caused a split in the community, often described as a \u2018battle of ethics and ideology\u2019. The victims were investors in a fund called the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which was launched by the Ethereum community as a decentralized investment fund for smart contract projects. \n\n Instead of a few venture capitalist partners making decisions on which projects to invest in, DAO holders were promised a voting input in investments. The project was so popular that the ICO attracted over $150 million in funding. \n\n In June, 3.6 million Ether (worth approximately $50 million USD) was taken from accounts in the DAO and moved to another account without the owners' consent, exploiting one of several vulnerabilities that had already been flagged by community members. A loophole in the code allowed someone to repeat a refund request multiple times for the same DAO tokens before the transaction could be registered on the system. The recursive function was able to run until a third of DAO\u2019s funds were siphoned off. \n\n Ironically the stolen currency can never be spent because the code in the blockchain would allow them to be traced. Following the hack, there was a majority decision that Ethereum needed to fork and create something new from scratch. \n\n The new protocol retained the original name Ethereum (ETH) because of the amount of community support for the fork. It functions on a brand new blockchain, and the vast majority of miners, users, and protocol from the previous version of Ethereum use this new version. In this sense, Ethereum functions more like a software company. ETH\u2019s primary value is in its use case scenarios and community support. The Ethereum Alliance, for example, consists of billion-dollar firms such as Accenture, JP Morgan, Microsoft, and UBS. The Ethereum chain that forked (ETH) was able to retrieve the $50 million that was hacked and return it to investors. \n\n Ethereum Classic (ETC) has a new name but is the original version of the Ethereum protocol using the original blockchain. Only 10% of the community was in favor of keeping it, but it is said to still retain value because of the speculative nature of the crypto market.",

    "description": "Ether (ETH) (\u039e) is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum network. Unlike Bitcoin, which aims to disrupt the banking system with its own digital currency, the Ethereum platform\u2019s goal is to use blockchain to replace internet third parties, particularly those that store data, transfer mortgages, and keep track of complex financial instruments. \n\n Ethereum is made up of nodes run by volunteers across the world, the nodes form what has been described as a \u2018world computer\u2019, a decentralized mining network which is not governed by any third parties like, for example, servers and clouds are. \n\n The volunteers, or miners, use their own computational power (gas) to run the network. This involves passing blocks of code between each other and solving the mathematical problems that keep the code secure in exchange for Ether. The currency is listed on exchanges, and can only be used on the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for gas and transaction fees. \n\n Ethereum is open-source, public, and highly programmable. Anyone can use or modify its software to build upon the computing platform and operating system. The platform gives developers the opportunity to build their own digital assets on the Ethereum infrastructure without having to create their own blockchain. This has given rise to hundreds of Ethereum blockchain based tokens (such as Binance Coin, Golem, and Basic Attention Coin). In 2017, at the height of crypto-mania Ethereum was leading blockchain platform for Initial Coin Offering  (ICO) projects, with over 50% market share. \n\n The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. He believed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. When he was unable to gain agreement, he devised a new platform with a more general scripting language.

    "description": "What Is Electroneum (ETN)?\n\nElectroneum is a UK-based cryptocurrency consisting of around 50 employees. Launched in 2017 with a $40 million ICO, its platform aims to provide a mobile-first payment solution for the world\u2019s unbanked population, which to this day accounts for more than 1 billion people worldwide.\n\nWhilst the Electroneum app enables anyone to hold and transfer value in ETN instantly across the world at very little cost (a fraction of a US cent), it\u2019s their complementary platforms that have reportedly led the company to acquire 4+ million users worldwide.\n\nThousands of users are reportedly benefitting from ETN by selling their services on AnyTask.com \u2013 a freelance marketplace launched by Electroneum in 2020. The platform allows freelancers to sell their services for free and without incurring costs on their earnings, which are delivered instantly in ETN following the approval of their work.\n\nETNDonate.com is another solution launched by Electroneum in 2020, which aims to make it easier for charities to promote themselves for free. They receive international donations in ETN at zero cost and are able to move those donations anywhere in the world quickly, ensuring they go to the right place without incurring cross border transfer fees.\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, Electroneum voluntarily introduced KYC and AML compliance procedures in 2018 ahead of the European 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, ensuring all new users are onboarded accordingly and that Electroneum operates within guidelines set out by the 5th EU AML directive (and as subsequently enshrined in the laws of England & Wales).\n\nWhat Can Electroneum (ETN) be Used For?\n\nUsers can spend their ETN from within the Electroneum app on a growing number of everyday essentials, including electricity and mobile airtime and data. These services have already been used thousands of times and Electroneum has pledged to continue adding more services just like this. Businesses can also begin accepting ETN via the app, or via the growing list of API integrations. For a full list of where you can spend ETN, visit the official Electroneum store directory - ETNEverywhere.com.\n\nCan You Mine Electroneum (ETN)?\n\nNo, the Electroneum blockchain is a permissioned network. In 2019, Electroneum responded to corporate demand by moving to an in-house designed protocol called Proof of Responsibility (PoR). Compared with Proof of Work (PoW), this brought with it a host of benefits, including greater security, a massive reduction in energy consumption, and a redirection of ETN block rewards to educational initiatives.\n\nHow Does Electroneum (ETN) Work?\n\nElectroneum\u2019s blockchain consists of a monitoring layer that evaluates the network for security breach attempts. This layer provides Electroneum with a minimal, but sufficient level of interference to secure the network against a double-spend or 51% attack. If hackers were to breach the security of a permissioned validator, the moderating layer would immediately detect the breach and rescind the rights of that miner.\n\nWhat is an Electroneum (ETN) Halving?\n\nIn July 2020, Electroneum pledged to keep ETN\u2019s inflation rate to less than 2%. With that in mind, they implemented a series of halving events, the first of which took place in July 2020 and will continue every four years until 2032. After the 2032 halving, no more block reward reductions are planned until the maximum supply of 21 billion ETN is reached. Once this point is reached, the block reward gets reduced from 50 ETN to 25 ETN per block.\n\nHow Do You Buy Electroneum (ETN)?\n\nYou can buy ETN on any exchange that offers the token. For the full list of exchanges and trading pairs, please click on the market pairs tab above or visit Electroneum.com. Remember to do your own research before choosing an exchange.\n\nHow Do You Store Electroneum (ETN)?\n\nWhilst you can store ETN on an exchange, the team always recommends using a wallet. You can store ETN within the Electroneum app, or for greater security, you can store your ETN on a paper wallet, which is downloadable at Electroneum.com. Ledger support is also coming in 2020 for ETN, so be sure to sign up for our updates at the Electroneum Newsroom.",

    "description": "Factom is a decentralized open-sourced data integrity protocol aimed to solve real-world business problems through the introduction of an unalterable record-keeping system.  The creation of a data layer on top of the blockchain helps the distributed ledger technology to secure millions of real-time records with a hash.  Factom offers a very convenient method of documenting information without the possibility of its further deletion or modification.  \n\nDecentralized record-keeping technology offered by the platform delivers transparency and user privacy simultaneously.  The technology gives the power of Bitcoin blockchain to an unlimited range of applications and users.  The team released its protocol on an open-source basis in 2018.  The mission of the company is to provide assistance to businesses and governments to keep records and manage data securely.\n\nThe project was launched by a blockchain innovations company Factom, Inc. in 2014.  The company itself is headquartered in Austin, Texas, USA, but also operates from different countries all around the world.  It has offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Honduras, London and Sunnyvale, California.\n\nFactom goals\n\nThe lack of trust decreases efficiency in a global economy, and Factom tries to solve this problem providing the precise, verifiable, and immutable audit trail to place instead of blind faith.  Neither the records which people used in the past nor the computers are effective enough for data protection.  Blockchain technology is a good solution to the problem as it makes data verifiable and independently auditable providing the highest level of security.  \n\nFactom has created a distributed autonomous protocol by extending Bitcoin\u2019s feature set to record events outside of monetary transfers.  In this way, Factom gives businesses and organizations access to the blockchain technology without getting bogged down in currencies.\n\nFactom technology\n\nFactom has designed a solution to secure sensitive financial and personal information protecting it with a hash technology.  A hash means a cryptographic one-way function that transforms digital data turning it into an alphanumeric string that can\u2019t be changed.  Factom technology makes hashes via API transforming them into a single hash that is anchored to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain as an immutable time stamp.  \n\nThe hashing algorithm splits the sensitive data into fragments with further distribution across different blockchains for a higher level of security.  The encrypted data is stored in separate blockchain data vaults.  Such an approach has proved to be highly secure.\n\nFactom resembles BitTorrent technology.  An entry block is made by hashing together many small 10KB files.  Then they are hashed and indexed into the directory blocks, which are anchored to Bitcoin blockchain creating 10 blocks every 10 minutes during BTC mining.  It helps to create an effective sidechain solution with a minimum amount of data required for each block.  The data is packaged so that it can be shared on a P2P network.\n\nFactom uses three kinds of proofs to ensure verification of documents: Proof of Existence, Proof of Process and Proof of Audit.  The network of Federated servers is employed for the collection, packaging, and securing of data in the Bitcoin blockchain.  Each server can only control part of the system but doesn\u2019t have control over the entire system.\n\nFactom ICO and other details\n\nAll fundraising efforts made by Factom were quite successful.  The company raised 1.1 million USD in a crowd sale in 2015 and a little later 400,000 USD in seed funding.  In October 2016, Factom raised 4,2 million USD, followed by 8 million USD in April 2017 and 6 million USD in August 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Factom is architected in such a way that users don\u2019t need any coins to use the platform.  Two separate tokens are powering the network: Factoids (FCT) and Entry Credits (ECs).  Operating on their own chain within Factom, Factoids are needed to upload data to the network.  They can be stored on Factom Enterprise Wallet, which is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux, or Papermill paper wallet and can be downloaded from the Factom website.  There is an opportunity to select a Secure (encrypted) or Not Secure (unencrypted) wallet.\n\nThe Factoid supply is unlimited.  This coin is not mined, but earned by Federated Servers, acting as the communication channel between other nodes, which are named Audit Servers and Follower Servers, and the blockchain.\n\nFCT is traded on such exchanges as Bittrex, Upbit, Cointree, Poloniex, and BCEX.  Factoids are paid as a reward to servers maintaining the network.  The platform releases 73,000 FCT per month.  The issued number doesn\u2019t depend upon the price.  Entry Credits are used to pay for Entries (adding data to the protocol) or to vote for Federated servers.  Also, used Entry Credits can\u2019t leave the system.  Though ECs don\u2019t have intrinsic value, the addition of data to the Factom blockchain is impossible without them.  This cryptocurrency was made non-transferrable to make them less attractive for hackers.  Factoids are needed to buy Entry Credits.  After Entry Credits are used, Factoids, which were used for their purchase, are burnt.\n\nFactom team and partners\n\nThe head of the platform, Paul Snow, CEO, is one of those who invented the patent used by Factom.  He is also simultaneously the head of the Texas Bitcoin Association.  The list of other inventors includes Mahesh Paolini-Subramanya, the former EVP of engineering who worked for the company until the patent application was submitted, and Brian Deery, the chief scientist of Factom.\n\nThe company was first became known in 2014 after integration into the Microsoft Azure platform.  It brought increased publicity to the company, while its token rose by 600% in value.  In 2015, Factom partnered with the government of Honduras on a land title registry project where the company offered a secure land title record system.  In 2016, Factom entered the partnership with the Chinese government, securing a smart city deal.  In November 2016 it received two grants from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a prototype of a digitized medical record system for individuals living in remote developing areas of the world.  In June 2018, the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security has awarded a grant to Factom, delivered for support of beta testing of a platform working to secure data from Border Patrol cameras and sensors.",

    "symbol": "FIL",
    "name": "Filecoin",
    "description": "Filecoin (FIL) is a utility token issued by a decentralized storage network founded by Juan Benet.  The platform employs open-source technology that aims to enhance the work of the internet.  The token resides on its native blockchain which is based on both proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime protocols.\n\nThe company standing behind the project is Protocol Labs from California, US.  The team announced the start of work on the Filecoin project back in 2014 with the goal to create a decentralized service for the distributed storage of information.  Working on the project, developers have created a new communication protocol IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which was supposed to replace the outdated HTTP.  Filecoin is one of the projects that made a big splash even before the launch of a massive fundraising campaign.  Thus, it\u2019s not surprising that the project became one of the biggest ICOs of 2017.\n\nThe goals of the Filecoin platform\n\nThe team of developers plans to compete with such giants as Google, Amazon, or Dropbox in the field of data storage.  The scheme involves the creation of a distributed network for storing a wide variety of information of any size, be it a single file or huge databases.\n\nThe problem is that internet users from remote corners of the world can experience problems with access to cloud storage services, the speed, and ping of connections.  It occurs because the vast majority of servers providing cloud storage services are located in Europe and the United States.  They are also concentrated in the hands of the largest market players, and this deteriorates the situation.\n\nFilecoin platform and technologies\n\nTo solve this problem, Protocol Labs offers to place information on multiple computers of its network participants instead of keeping it in one place.  Using the IPFS protocol, the system splits data, places it on a large number of PCs, and if necessary searches for the nearest network nodes to access them, thus ensuring the optimal connection speed.  Any member of the Filecoin project with free space on the hard disk can rent it out for storing information while receiving a reward in the form of FIL tokens.\n\nThe main difference between the architecture of building a network of the Filecoin cryptocurrency from most analogs is the presence of two types of nodes: Storage Nodes and Retrieval Nodes.  Storage Nodes physically represent the space allocated by the network member for storing information on their hard disks.  The preference is given to the nodes of the average size of the available volume, because large nodes lead to centralization, and too small nodes decrease the quality of the network.  These nodes are paid for storing information on them.  As for Retrieval Nodes, this type of node is unique to the Filecoin network.  The main requirement for them is a high speed of Internet connection, low ping, and close location to nodes of the first type where information is stored.\n\nThe task of the retrieval nodes is to find and transmit information to users according to the requests submitted.  The one who copes with it first gets paid.  Therefore, those search nodes that are located in places with a large concentration of working storage nodes are competitive.\nThe owners of the nodes receive a reward for ensuring the network's operability, the fair distribution of which is ensured by the Proof-of-Replication consensus mechanism.  All storage node owners receive a reward proportional to the amount of memory allocated.  However, the \"miners\" must prove that they created a certain number of copies of different files.  This approach increases the reliability of information storage since it is duplicated many times by different nodes.\n\nAfter numerous delays, the Filecoin platform was launched on October 15, 2020.  At the same time, the FIL tokens, subject to a vesting schedule, began their distribution.\n\nFilecoin ICO and FIL token\n\nIn August 2017, an ICO was conducted to raise funds for the further development of the project.  The interest of investors was so big that the required 252 million USD was raised within half an hour despite the fact that the ICO was held on the CoinList site in accordance with the strict SEC rules.  They implied the participation of only US residents who passed full verification on the platform.  In particular, this meant confirmed data on the paying capacity of the participant.  For individuals, the income level had to exceed 200,000 USD per year, and for companies, that number was more than one million.  It was estimated that 3,500 entities have received FIL tokens.\n\nThe most notable investors included Winklevoss Capital, Digital Currency Group, Andreessen Horowitz, Naval Ravikant, Y Combinator, and others.  The investors did not receive FIL tokens in return.  Instead, the project sold SAFTs (Simple Agreements for Future Tokens).  The Filecoin supply is capped at 2 billion coins.  New Filecoin tokens can be released via block rewards only.\n\nAccording to the project roadmap, the distribution of tokens is the following: 70% of the total amount is reserved for paying rewards to miners for network maintenance; 15% is allocated to the project developers; 10% is used to pay off to investors who contributed to the project at the ICO stage; 5% remains in a special fund to finance future developments.\n\nAfter the launch of the mainnet, several largest cryptocurrency exchanges confirmed the support of the FIL coin.  The most prominent among them are Kraken, Huobi, and Gemini.\n\nFilecoin team\n\nThe team includes 12 core developers with Juan Benet at the head.  Juan Benet, the CEO of the Protocol Labs, is an American computer scientist, graduate of Stanford University, who received recognition for the creation of the Interplanetary File System, a decentralized P2P web protocol.  Previously, he worked as CTO of Loki Studios that developed a multiplayer mobile game Geomon and was eventually purchased by Yahoo! in 2013.",

    "description": "GAS is a utility token which is used primarily on the NEO blockchain with the key purpose to cover transaction fees.  It has similar functions to gas utilized on Ethereum, but its core difference lies in its generation process.  GAS tokens are created automatically if you hold NEO on your wallet for a period of time.\n\nTo understand the key features of GAS, one should get at least a brief knowledge of what NEO represents.  Launched in 2014, this project is often referred to as \u201cEthereum\u2019s killer\u201c or \u201cChinese Ethereum\u201d since it aims to provide developers with a similar platform for dApps\u2019 creation.  Its key advantage is that it has managed to solve the scalability issue inherent to all Ethereum-based platforms.  NEO has the built-in system of smart contracts, but unlike Solidity-based contracts on Ethreum, these ones are much more developer-friendly as they are based on well-known programming languages such as Go, Python, Javascript, and C#.\n\nThe key cryptocurrency NEO fueling the platform acts as a proof of stake and gives NEO holders the right to participate in the platform\u2019s development.  In order to do that, they can stake their coins to support some specific proposals.  In order to make a transaction, it\u2019s required to pay network fees, and that\u2019s where GAS can help as it covers these fees.  Its other functions include resource allocation, network charges and incentivizing the participants.\n\nGAS can be obtained on some popular exchange platforms such as Binance, Coinone, OKEx or Digifinex, but it can also be earned for holding NEO.  The proof-of-stake consensus algorithm implies distributing 8 GAS coins across all NEO holders for every newly generated block.  The size of the reward is proportional to the amount of staked coins.\n\nWhile NEO token is indivisible, GAS can be divided by a factor of 1/10^8.  This coin is not pre-mined and has a finite supply of 100 million tokens which will be generated via a decay algorithm by the year 2040.\n\nAss the project operates from China, the information about its founders is pretty scarce as they prefer working within their home region.  The co-founders of NEO are Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang, but their background remains veiled.",

    "description": "The Golem Network Token (GNT) is an ERC-20 token that Golem ecosystem participants can use for exchanging value between each other.  This is a utility token as it can only be used within the dedicated system.  Developers use GNT tokens to pay for resources and application usage while requesters compensate providers with their help.  The main idea behind the project is to combine the power of multiple users\u2019 machines across the globe so as to create an open-source decentralized supercomputer.  The Golem platform represents a distributed cloud that aims to provide application owners with access to the computing resources that can be used for resolving complex computational tasks such as video rendering.  It can be particularly useful for those who\u2019s machines don\u2019t have enough capacity for performing such tasks and need additional power to speed up the process.  The Golem platform is an open-source decentralized marketplace for computing power that can be controlled by its users.  It offers an alternative to huge cloud providers with their closed networks, expensive patented solutions, and hard-coded provisioning operations.    Those who want to become part of this network can loan their computers\u2019 spare resources (CPU or GPU) to others who need extended computational power.  Golem utilized the same principles of sharing economy that underlie such services as Uber and AirBnb.  Small PC owners and large data centers, anyone can join and earn GNT tokens.  It offers a simple way to make extra money by sharing your unused resources or to get access to cheap computing power.  The key target audience of the Golem Network comprises of dApps\u2019 developers, businesses working with large amounts of data, scientists working in the same area and technicians working on machine learning.    Golem\u2019s roadmap consists of the following key milestones: Brass Golem.  This is a proof-of-concept stage with the key focus on rendering. Clay Golem.  At this stage, implementing the Task API and Application Registry is the key addition aimed to provide developers with full integration with the platform.  Also, the team plans to implement machine learning and support sandboxing on virtual machines. Stone Golem.  This stage is aimed at stabilizing and securing the network.  The proposed functionality includes Full Task API, support for SaaS and application registry. Iron Golem.  This is the final stage giving developers the freedom to create applications outside of the sandbox.  According to the project\u2019s whitepaper, the technology will be fully tested by that time and will be able to gain interest outside of the cryptocurrency field.  It\u2019s worth noting that Golem is not the only project of such kind in the industry.  Their nearest competitor is iExec with the focus on off-chain computations.  BOINC and SOMN do something similar as well, but Golem\u2019s team believes that there is still enough space for everyone.  Golem conducted the Initial Coin Offering in November 2016 and raised 820,000 ETH (~8 million USD at that time) in 20 minutes.  12% of tokens were held by the project and 6% more were distributed across early investors and team members.    The GNT token is available for trading on many exchange platforms, including Huobi Global, Binance and Korean Upbit.  One cannot mine GNT, but tokens can be earned by lending spare computing power to the network.  Golem tokens can be stored on all ERC-20 compatible wallets such as Metamask and MyEtherWallet.  In addition, they are supported by the cold wallet Trezor with enhanced security options.  Most members of the Golem\u2019s team are based in Poland.  Piotr Janiuk, the project\u2019s co-founder and CTO, has a Master\u2019s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.  He started off his career as a software engineer and changed a few positions before he ended up as a senior lead developer at Imapp where he met most of his future companions for the Golem project.  His colleague and the project\u2019s COO Andrzej Regulski has worked together with him since 2008 - first at Polish Institute of Structural Research (IBS), and then at Imapp.",

    "description": "The Graph (Graph Network) is a decentralized data-indexing protocol for networks like Ethereum, POA, and IPFS.  This is a middle layer between numerous blockchains and decentralized applications and The Graph has been already integrated with lots of them.  The Graph\u2019s hosted service is processing over 4 billion queries per month for various applications and it is always exploring new blockchain integrations, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe Graph was created in July 2018.  On December 17, 2020, The Graph launched its mainnet.  The main open source elements that make up the Graph\u2019s ecosystem are Graph Node, Graph TS, and Graph CLI.  GRT is the native token of the platform that is used to coordinate its performance.\n\nWhat are subgraphs\n\nSubgraphs represent a very important element fueling the platform.  Any user can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible in cases when it is hard to receive directly from the blockchain.  They are used for the storage of data for specific dApps.  The subgraph determines what data The Graph will index from Ethereum, and how it will store it.  Once deployed, it will form a part of a global graph of blockchain data.\n\nOnce created, a subgraph cannot be ever deleted and its name cannot be changed.  At the time of writing, there are over 7,000 subgraphs for Balancer, Synthetix, Uniswap, Aragon, Livepeer, Gnosis, DAOstack, Decentraland, AAVE, etc.  \n\nThe Graph Network Participants\n\nThere are four main groups of users that play important roles in the platform\u2019s ecosystem: Indexers, Curators, Delegators, and Consumers.  The first three groups maintain the work of the network while Consumers are the end-users of the network\u2019s services.\n\nThe Indexers operate the nodes of the network and they are motivated to earn the GRT rewards.  The Curators signal what subgraphs are worth being indexed the first among other subgraphs.  They do it with the help of GRT.  Usually, the Curators are the developers and end-users.  Delegators delegate their GTR to the Indexers without obligation to run their own nodes.  In return, they receive a part of indexing rewards and fees.  The Consumers have to pay the Indexers for the request processing and transmission.\n\nGraph GRT token\n\nGRT is a utility ERC-20 token designed to fuel The Graph protocol.  The maximum token supply is 10 billion.  Around 1% of query fees and all deposit taxes are expected to be burnt.\n\nThe public sale of GRT took place on October 22, 2020.  400M tokens were sold to users that are called Original Graphers who were the initial GRT community members at The Graph\u2019s mainnet launch.  More than 4,500 individuals from 99 countries (Russia, Vietnam, China, India, Great Britain, etc) received GRT and got a right to participate in The Graph Network as Indexers, Curators, or Delegators by providing their services to decentralized applications.  The US residents had no right to participate.  The project representatives reported that 12 million USD had been raised in the public sale.  \n\nThe overall token distribution is as following: 35% is dedicated to the community, 23% belongs to the early team and advisors, 7% is for backers, and 8% is dedicated to Edge & Node, the Graph Foundation\u2019s subsidiary that develops software.\n\nThe major part of the token amount that is dedicated to the community belongs to the Graph Foundation (58%).  12% was sold at the GRT public sale and 6% was allocated to the strategic GRT sale.  The rest of the community tokens are spent on the programs and rewards: educational programs (6%), bug bounties (1%), testnet indexer reward (9%), curator program grants (9%).  The token can be used for Indexer Staking and Curator Signaling.  All the payments are also settled in GRT.\n\nGRT can be bought on some exchanges: Binance, OKEx, Huobi, etc.  It is also possible to earn the token by taking part in various events.  For example, any user can get 10 GRT for free by participating in the quiz on CoinMarketCap.  The participants need to answer several questions about The Graph project to receive the reward.  Also, 30,000 GRT were distributed during the Global Rental Token Airdrop.\n\nThe Graph security\n\nBefore launching the mainnet, The Graph\u2019s security was thoroughly tested.  It was audited several times to increase trust and confidence.  In October 2020, it was audited by OpenZeppelin, a company that provides audits of decentralized systems, and Trail of Bits, an independent information security company.  An audit of the state channels implementation was provided by Consensys Diligence.\n\nThe Bug Bounty program aims to improve the security of the platform.  The users that have managed to find vulnerabilities in the protocol infrastructure are to be rewarded in GRT.  There are three types of bounties depending on the severity and complexity of the bug.  Rewards will range from 100 to 50,000 USD worth of GRT.\n\nThe Graph team and partners\n\nThe project was founded by Yaniv Tal (Project Lead), Jannis Pohlman (Tech Lead), and Brandon Ramirez (Research Lead).  They have engineering backgrounds and prior to The Graph, they had already worked together on several startups.  Tal and Ramirez live in the US, and Pohlman resides in Germany.\n\nIn October 2020, The Graph Foundation was created to coordinate and support The Graph\u2019s ecosystem after the mainnet launch.  Eva Beylin is the Director of The Graph Foundation.  Prior to this position, she worked with several crypto projects like MolochDAO, the Ethereum Foundation, etc.  The initial team reported that they changed their name from Graph Protocol, Inc.  to Edge & Node to highlight that they were no longer the central team.\nThe Graph\u2019s management will be decentralized in the future and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) will be created.  It is planned that the project will be governed by The Graph Council.  It will respect the interest of five main groups of influencers: Indexers, active token holders, the initial team, users, and technical domain experts.\n\nThe project is backed by serious investors like Coinbase Ventures, Framework Ventures, Digital Currency Group, and others.  5 million USD were raised at the private token sale.",

Because the Chinese government banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto trading in China in September 2017, Huobi could not hold a sale for the HT tokens.  Instead, the company gave away 300 million (60%) Huobi Tokens to users who purchased a service fee package on the Huobi exchange.  With the remaining supply of HT (200 million), 20 percent went to user rewards and platform operations while the other 20 percent was allocated to the team with a lock-up period of four years.\n\nHT token holders receive transaction fee discounts, early access to special Huobi events, crypto rewards from seasonal buybacks, and voting rights on exchange decisions (e.g. what new assets will be included on the exchange).\n\nTo control its supply, Huobi uses 20 percent of its quarterly net profits to buy back HT based on its market price.  The funds bought back are stored in an Ethereum address as a reserve called the Huobi Investor Protection Fund (HIPF).  If the exchange is ever hacked and user funds are compromised, the HIPF will be used to restore the funds to the affected users.\n\nHuobi is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges still in operation.

    "description": "ICON (ICX) is a cryptocurrency that can be used for real-time payments and also as a protocol for connecting blockchains with other blockchains in the ICON Network.  According to the white paper, \u201cThe ICON Project aims to build a decentralized network that allows independent blockchains with different governances to transact with one another without intermediaries.\u201d The goal is to build a platform where companies from various industries (e.g., healthcare, insurance, financial, educational, commerce) can interact and transact on a single network.\n\nICON was founded in 2017 by the Seoul based company, IconLoop (formally called theloop).  IconLoop is responsible for creating a private enterprise blockchain solution called loopchain.  The company has partnerships throughout the banking, healthcare, insurance, and financial industries.  IconLoop created ICON (a public blockchain) after hearing from its private enterprise customers that they wanted their private blockchains to have the ability to communicate with one another.  In other words, the companies utilizing loopchain (private blockchains) desired interoperability with other blockchains.  These companies saw the value in sharing data in a public network, thus the ICON network was born.  According to the white paper, anyone can create a new blockchain project and join the ICON network.\n\nIconLoop is owned by the DAYLI Financial Group (DFG), one of the largest fintech groups in South Korea.  DFG also owns Coinone (a popular cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea) as well as DaVinci (the largest AI provider in South Korea).\n\nICON uses a consensus algorithm called delegated proof of contribution (DPoC).  Similar to delegated proof of stake, (DPoS), ICON uses a proxy voting mechanism where token holders delegate their coins to P-Rep (public representative) candidates.  With enough votes, these public representatives will receive control of the network and produce as well as verify blocks on behalf of the users who delegated their coins to them.  The representatives can be changed at any time depending on their contribution level or governance status within the ICON Network.\n\nIn October 2017, ICON held an ICO where half (400,230,000) of the total supply (800,460,000) of ICX was sold to the public.  According to the website, the release schedule of the other 50% of total supply will be determined through annual C-Rep consultation.\n\nIn May of 2018, ICON announced a partnership with LINE, a global social media application company with over 200 million monthly users.  As of the time of this writing, LINE is the most popular messaging app in Japan and Thailand.  Together, ICON and LINE co-founded \u2018Unchain,\u2019 which is an effort to construct LINE\u2019s blockchain network. \n\nMin Kim is a cofounder of ICON.  Before ICON, Kim was an investment banker, financial executive, and startup founder. \n\nICON has the backing of well-known partners including Pantera Capital, Kinetic Capital, and CM Crypto Capital.",

    "description": "Aiming to create monetary incentives for gamers and a way for game developers to provide monetary rewards in their games, ION is a decentralized blockchain cryptocurrency that rewards its users through a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d consensus system. Alongside ION, Economy, a digital entertainment platform for gamers and game developers was also launched in April 2016. ION is based mostly on the idea of making it easier for game developers to incentivize participation in both their premium and free games. The motto of the ION cryptocurrency platform economy is \u201cThe Business of Fun\u201d, and it mainly tries to add a social component to digital currency, making it fun and bringing in the possibility for networking.\r\n\r\nION is a digital currency which is primarily given as rewards and incentives to gamers playing on its platform, Economy. It aims to make cryptocurrency fun and social, while simultaneously rewarding gamers for participation. The ION cryptocurrency works on the \u201cstatic proof-of-stake\u201d consensus system, which ensures that inactive investors cannot take advantage of it. The \u201cConnectivity\u201d system it works on makes the rewards proportional to the number of active users, promoting the community and keeping things fair while encouraging more people to participate. ION has also implemented a master node network, which can be used to perform advanced functions and ensure smoother and much faster transactions for larger holders.\r\n\r\nThe best part of ION, perhaps, is that ION tokens are given as a reward to gamers playing on the economy platform, and they are free to trade the coins for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies, too. Rather than other popular cryptocurrencies that focus on buying and selling of goods and are investment-centric (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>), ION is focused on the gaming sector. It aims to give active gamers an incentive for participation and game developers a chance to add monetary incentives to their freedom as well as premium games. It\u2019s focused on \u201ceverything that\u2019s fun\u201d, according to the ionomy website, whose very motto is \u201cThe Business of Fun\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor a cryptocurrency launched before the crypto boom in 2017, ION has its advantages, the main one being that it boasts of being \u201cfun\u201d, unlike any other currency. The reward of winning is adequate for a true gamer, but an incentive involving money doesn\u2019t hurt. Games on the ION platform like \u201cTo The Moon (Beta)\u201d and \u201cCrypto Gravity\u201d (available for both Android and iOS) are gaining ground among gamers, and ION can only go up from where it is currently. Another perk of the ION cryptocurrency is that if you invest in it, in-app purchases on the games in the ION platform come much cheaper. ION developers offer up to 50% off on the purchases, if ION tokens are used. The cryptocurrency has just about started gaining ground within the gaming community, and its motto of \u201cfun\u201d and accessible nature are its selling points, making it likely to give returns in the long term.",

    "description": "IOST or the Internet of Services Token is an open-source token that was issued by the decentralized blockchain platform with the same name.  The token was created on the basis of the Ethereum network.  The founders of the company have rich experience in enterprise management and blockchain projects.  \n\nThe token stands out from other similar projects in terms of operability, and the focus on high-value industries that include cloud computing, online advertising, and the prediction market.  The company often employs aggressive marketing practices and social media activities.  \n\nThe company behind the facility is headquartered in Singapore.  The task of the team was to solve the problems hindering integration and mass adoption of cryptocurrencies such as transaction throughput and scalability.  Many tasks set by the company have been successfully solved since then.  For instance, the platform has attained one of the highest TPS rates in the industry.  Also, the IOST founders try to develop a thriving ecosystem, which creates apps in the gaming sphere, social networking, and the DeFi industry.  \n\nIOST platform and technologies\n\nThe blockchain\u2019s infrastructure was developed with a focus on scalability and security.  The engine of the platform is able to process up to 100,000 transactions per second.  So when the network calls itself ultra-fast, there is a reason behind it.  Absolutely new blockchain architecture was designed by highly qualified experts of the company to acquire such a high-rocketing speed.  Some innovative technologies were employed when the architecture was created such as Efficient Distributed Sharding that partitions the network into sub-sectors assigning random nodes to work jointly thus bringing to smoother and faster work of the system.  The platform also uses Distributed Randomness Protocol, TransEpoch, Micro State Blocks, and Atomix.  \n\nThe network is based on a consensus protocol of the future that is called proof of believability (PoB).  The validation of nodes is based on behavioral patterns and contributions in the past.  Incorporating a \u201cfairness\u201d algorithm with a random distribution of data to various nodes, the system contributes to the development of a fairly decentralized protocol.  The consensus algorithm was designed by the team of the platform to deliver security and efficiency of transactions.  IOST\u2019s Node Program was admitted by blockchain research institutions as one of the best staking programs in the world.  It features low risks, high returns, and ease of use.  \n\nThe IRC-722 NFT standard was released by the company in April 2020.  The platform entered the NFT industry partnering with the Japanese blockchain game developer Platinum Egg and started to create the TokenLink NFT marketplace.\n\nIn January 2021 Binance joined the IOST blockchain as a partner node, improving and stabilizing the IOST ecosystem.  It means that Binance users can stake IOST on the Binance platform and earn IOST rewards.  \n\nIOST token\n\nThe total supply of the IOST token is 21 billion.  40% of tokens were sold through private sales to institutional investors arranged in January 2018.  The company managed to raise over 31 million USD worth of Ethereum.  The token with high-end security features is very attractive for investors thanks to its strong performance, extensive functionality of the platform, its entrance to decentralized industry, and the addition of NFT to the facility.  \n\n35% tokens are allocated to the IOST Foundation, 12.5% is given to the community, while 10% and 2.5% are allocated to the team and investors correspondingly.  Customers can acquire the token on such exchanges as Binance, Bittrex, Livecoin, and others.  The token is an ERC-20 token so it can be stored in any wallet that is compatible with Ethereum such as MyEtherWallet, Mist, MetaMask, and many others.\n\nIOST team\n\nThe founders of the facility are Jimmy Zhong, Justin Li, Terrence Wang, Sa Wang, Kevin Tan, and Ray Xiao.  The founder Jimmy Zhong studied computer science at the University of Minnesota and Princeton University.  He also worked as an Uber software engineer.  When he was a student, he launched tech startups in the USA and China.  The first company established by him was sold for 40 million USD.  \n\nOther co-founders also studied computer science including Justin Li who was an investment expert in Goldman Sachs.  He also took the position of a data scientist at Mobike.  Kevin Tan is a co-founder of Ethercap, while Ray Xiao, Sa Wang, and Jimmy Zhong are co-founders of Dora, an AI-based company producing intelligent kiosks.  \n\nIOST partnerships\n\nLooking for alternatives outside of the Ethereum network as a result of network congestion, IOST started the partnership with the new DeFi platform Donnie Finance.  The partnership was announced in December 2020.  The company cooperates with Polkadot to build a cross-chain transfer bridge to the Polkadot Ecosystem.  The platform also partners with Japanese health tech venture Pracs, developing the Personal Health Record (PHR) system allowing users to manage their own health information.  In 2020, the company also collaborated with the Chinese government to foster blockchain adoption.",

    "description": "IoTeX Network is an open-source project founded in 2017 by a non-profit foundation registered in Singapore.  It was created with the purpose to build up a network for the Internet of Things (IoT) powered by a scalable blockchain.  IoT is the term used to describe the global network of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data via the internet.  \n\nThe IoTeX team strives to bring together humans and machines, IoT smart devices, and decentralized applications, ensuring that they interact with trust and privacy.  They aim to give users full control of their gadgets, such as security cameras, drones, or fitness trackers, and data.   \n\nIoTeX decentralized blockchain was launched in April 2019.  It is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible and also works with Polygon, Chainlink, Binance, and other blockchains.  The blockchain is endlessly scalable potentially allowing billions of middlewares, dApps, and IoT devices to be built on it without intrusive ads and surveillance.  Developers get all the necessary tools and data to make and launch their applications and networks.  Users pay only $1 for 5,000 transactions.  Mainnet v1.3, which includes the latest EVM Istanbul and supports all Web3 DApps with minimal storage gas, was launched on July 23, 2021.\n\nIoTeX is secured by several mechanisms including delegated proof-of-stake, ring signature, and the payment code that hides addresses of transaction recipients.  Besides, it has implemented a user- and device-oriented Decentralized Identifier Protocol (DID) where an individual, organization, or device can own their own identity attributes without relying on third-party service providers.  At the time of writing the platform is run by 60+ delegates from all over the world including Blockfolio, CoinGecko, and DraperDragon.\n\nIoTeX token\n\nIoTeX (IOTX) is the native token for the IoTeX network.  It is a governance token with a maximum supply limited to 10 billion coins.  There was no ICO for IOTX.  Instead, in February 2018, a private sale was held, resulting in 24% of tokens distributed and 25,000 ETH raised.  18% of the total supply is kept as the Ecosystem Fund reserve, to be used to improve the ecosystem and incentivize all its entities.  12% of coins were locked for Roll-DPoS (a Randomized Delegated Proof of Stake) mining and released after the Mainnet Alpha launch in February 2019.  6% is spent on community reward programs.  The team got 15% of the total supply.  The coins are vested within 4 years after the date a team member joined.  25% was reserved for the foundation.  The funds are spent on IoTeX blockchain building, IoTeX project development, and cryptography research.  \n\nThe IOTX token falls into several categories of utility to ensure network decentralization and reliable and transparent interaction between various entities in the IoTeX ecosystem, including stakeholders, delegates, service providers, product developers, and consumers.  Apart from being a medium of exchange, IOTX can be used for staking and governance, paying transaction fees, accessing various ecosystem resources, and registering new devices on the IoTeX network.\n\nIOTX is used as the gas to execute transactions on the blockchain.  IOTX holders can stake their tokens and earn about 10%+ annual interest on their assets.  In addition, staking allows them to participate in governance.  IoTeX has implemented Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm, which means that block producers (Delegates) responsible for adding new blocks to the ledger are elected by stakeholders through voting.  In return, they distribute a portion of their rewards among their voters.  \n\nIOTX is listed on many exchanges including Binance, Huobi Global, Upbit, HBTC, Coinbase, and KuCoin where it is traded against BTC, USD, EUR, and GBP.  It can be stored in the platform\u2019s ioPay wallet or any ERC20 compatible wallet.\n\nTypes of IOTX \n\nThere are several types of IOTX: IOTX, WIOTX, CIOTX, which change their purpose with the help of ioTube, the cross-chain bridge that serves to transfer IOTX from IoTeX to other blockchains, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.  It converts IOTX or WIOTX to CIOTX.  \n\nWIOTX (wrapped IOTX) is an XRC20 token that can be used on the Ethereum blockchain and converted into native IOTX using the Mimo exchange.  BSC-Pegged IOTX is the BEP20 version of IOTX on Binance Smart Chain.  CIOTX (cross-chain IOTX) can be bridged and utilized on the Polygon network.\n\nBurn-Drop\n\nTo ensure the deflation of IOTX the team launched Burn-Drop.  It is a kind of tokenomics design that drives the token value for stakeholders as the number of devices powered by IoTeX increases.  There will be 10 Burn-Drop phases and 10% of the total IOTX supply is planned to be burned and dropped when the total number of devices reaches 1 million.  90% of the burn-dropped IOTX will be burned and taken out of circulation and 10% of them will be dropped or distributed to participants who stake for more than 91 days.  This process is performed by a smart contract and a new Burn-Drop is triggered each time a new Ucam or Pebble device is registered to the IoTeX network.  Long-term stakers can receive up to 15% APY additional rewards.\n\nIoTeX team and partners\n\nIoTeX is developed by a global team of 40+ research scientists, engineers, and designers from top tech companies with experience in information security, cryptography, and business development.  \n\nThe founders of IoTeX are Raullen Chai, Qevan Guo, Xinxin Fan, and Jing Sun.  Raullen, is the CEO at IoTeX and an advisor at BootUP Ventures.  Jing works as the Head of Investment and Ecosystem.  She is also an investor of several decentralized companies and a managing partner at Sparklend Capital.  Xinxin is the Head of Cryptography at IoTeX who directs the company's technical strategy and develops the core blockchain.  Fan was a senior research engineer at Bosch.  Qevan, a former Facebook research scientist is also the co-founder of Hyperconnect Lab.\n\nIoTeX works closely with IoT manufacturers, research institutions, and blockchain companies, which include Industrial Internet Consortium, a blockchain group, Nordic Semiconductor, and WISeKey, IoT chip manufacturers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and ThingsBoard, an IoT platform for device management.  IoTeX built Ucam in partnership with Tenvis, the industry leader of IP Video for Smart Home.",

Participating investors received 50% of the total supply (100 million KCS).  Founders were allocated 35% of the total supply (70 million KCS) subject to a four-year lock-up period.  The last 15% of the total supply (30 million KCS) were given to early investors and consultants with a two-year lock-up period.\n\nKuCoin plans on buying back and destroying 50% (100 million) of the total token supply over time resulting in a long-term fixed supply of 100 million KuCoin Shares once the buyback is complete.  According to the white paper, 10% of the quarterly profits generated from the KuCoin exchange will be used to buy KCS from the market to be burned.  Buybacks are published to the KCS blockchain explorer, allowing users to audit and confirm that the program is running as it should be.\n\nAll KuCoin Shares token holders with at least 6 KCS receive a dividend call \u201cKuCoin Bonus.\u201d  At the end of each trading day, 50% of that day's trading fees are collected and used to buyback KCS from the market.  This KCS is then distributed to KCS token holders based on the size of their holdings.\n\nIn addition to the bonus, KCS holders receive a discounted trading fee, which (at the time of this writing) can be as low as 0.0125%.  If a token holder reaches certain levels, they can qualify for special services like one-on-one investment consultation, customer service Fast-Pass, etc.\n\nKuCoin plans on launching a decentralized exchange in the future that utilizes the KCS token.",

    "name": "Komodo",
    "description": "Fueled by a native cryptocurrency KMD, Komodo describes itself as the industry's first open, composable Smart Chain platform.  As the project\u2019s development began back in 2014, Komodo can be considered one of the pioneers in building a multi-chain architecture resolving the problem of interoperability.  Komodo emerged as a fork of anonymous cryptocurrency Zcash (ZEC).\n\nTo enhance the network\u2019s security further, developers have modified the regular Proof-of-Work consensus that underlies Bitcoin.  Every 10 seconds Komodo makes the snapshots of its blockchain and inserts them into Bitcoin\u2019s chain.  This technique is called a Delayed-Proof-of-Work and it allows to restore the Komodo chain at any point in time.  Also, in order to conduct a successful attack on the network and tamper transactions on Komodo, one would have to change Bitcoin at the same time as well.  Thus, the system provides one of the highest security levels in the whole blockchain industry.\n\nMoreover, Komodo offers its services to other blockchain-based projects and helps them implement its DPoW mechanism to increase the security of their ecosystems.  It has already helped Kreds (KREDS).  GameCredits (GAME), SUQA (SUQA), Hush (HUSH) and Einsteinium (EMC2).\n\nThe blockchain platform for developers\nKomodo offers developers a blockchain-based platform with its own infrastructure with unprecedented levels of autonomy.  The platform is based on parallel chains that help developers create a separate copy of Komodo and write the code while staying unaffected by the events on the main chain.\n\nThe newly created parallel chains possess all the features of the main chain and thus they have the same level of security.  Developers can freely work on their projects without fearing any dangers imposed by hackers or by the platform\u2019s upgrades.\n\nKomodo\u2019s Decentralized Exchange (DEX)\nAnother product represented by Komodo is a decentralized exchange BarterDEX powered by atomic swaps.  It plays a key role in the whole ecosystem as it helps different chains communicate with each other.  With this product, Komodo aims to create the largest atomic swap network that will cover not only the parallel chains created on the platform itself but also all other external blockchains.  \n\nThe key features of the platform are the following:\nDecentralized Ordering via a secure order book\nLiquidity Provider nodes to help traders cope with issues related to low liquidity\nLiquidity Multiplier which lets traders place multiple orders for different assets using the same funds\nAtomic swaps which allow you to conduct trades right from your private wallet\nInteroperability for different blockchains including all systems based on Bitcoin and Ethereum\nZK-snarks technology which provides anonymity and privacy of transactions\nUsers have full control over their private keys\n\nAt the time of writing, developers claim that they have already successfully connected 95% of all chains, including those that were built upon Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nDecentralized Initial Coin Offers (dICOs)\nKomodo Platform provides the functionality which can help anyone launch their own blockchain or dICO.  Regardless of the coin you develop, it will stay on a separate chain powered by Komodo\u2019s DPoW technology.\n\nDecentralized ICOs have a number of benefits when compared to traditional ICOs and IEOs.  The investment process becomes safer and easier, atomic swap technologies facilitate transactions between different chains and all these transactions can be made anonymously.  One of the first projects which made use of Komodo\u2019s service was Utrum (OOT) advertising its technology as \u201cgrandma-friendly\u201d.\n\nKomodo coin (KMD)\nKomodo is fueled by its native coin KMD.  Since it is a fork of Zcash, it possesses all the same features.  It is created via mining using the Equihash algorithm with the total supply of 200 million coins that is expected to be reached by the year 2030.\n\nHere are some of KMD\u2019s use cases:\nInstant exchanges on Komodo\u2019s DEX\nYearly 5% rewards for all token holders\nPowering UTXO-Based Smart Contracts\nMeans of payment for Komodo\u2019s Blockchain Security Service\nCrowdfunding for dICO\u2019s launched on the Komodo Platform\nAvailable for mining both on CPU and GPU with 3 KMD reward per block\n\nThe coin is traded on many reputable exchange platforms including Binance, CoinEx, Huobi Global and Upbit.  It can be stored on the wallet specifically developed by Komodo\u2019s team and it is also supported by Coinomi and Ledger Nano S.\n\nKomodo ICO\nKomodo\u2019s ICO took place in 2016 between October 15th and November 20th.  The funds were accepted in BTC and the project managed to raise 2639 BTC which was close to 2 million USD as 1 BTC was worth ~700 USD at that time.\n\n100,000,000 KMD were issued for the crowdsale with 90% of them distributed among investors.  The rest was allocated for developers, advisors, and bounties.\n\nKomodo\u2019s team\nHolding on to the principles of anonymity, many members of Komodo\u2019s team preferred not to reveal their identity.  On the project\u2019s website, there are around 40 members, but not all of them display their full names and have the link to their Linkedin profile attached.\n\nThe project\u2019s CEO is named as James Lee with the nickname JL777 (no Linkedin profile to showcase the previous experience).  CTO was previously named as CA333 and now he is displayed under the name of Kadan Stadelmann.  According to his Linkedin profile, his career has been mostly built around software engineering and analytics.\n\nThe project has a good reputation as it has never been subject to any governmental investigation.  Moreover, it has a dedicated page of an Advanced Technology Partner on Amazon Web Services (AWS).",

    "name": "Kyber-Network",
    "description": "Kyber Network is an Ethereum-based on-chain liquidity protocol that combines liquidity from different reserves and provides decentralized applications with a convenient tool to instantly switch tokens between each other.  With the help of this protocol, developers can build a variety of decentralized financial tools that are not limited by a predefined set of payment options.  Kyber Network is fueled by a native utility token KNC.\n\nThe key issues that Kyber Network aims to resolve\n\nWith the growth of Bitcoin\u2019s popularity, many other blockchain-based projects have appeared, many of which build their own infrastructures and utilize different types of digital assets.  The diversity of cryptocurrencies is really impressive, but it creates additional obstacles for the end-users.  If a project is fueled, let\u2019s say, by Zcash and a user only has Litecoins or any other cryptocurrencies at hand, the exchange procedure has to be conducted.  The two most popular means of exchanging tokens include centralized and decentralized exchanges and they both have some significant flaws.\n\nThe first ones often become targets of hackers\u2019 attacks and cannot guarantee 100% security of users\u2019 funds.  Also, it may sometimes take several days to withdraw your funds from a platform that may be really inconvenient.  Decentralized exchanges eliminate these disadvantages, but have their own peculiarities.  Their key problem is the lack of liquidity to support active trading.  Also, the costs for every trade may be really high with the order book being kept on-chain.\n\nKyber Network comes up with a solution to all these issues as it creates a decentralized, on-chain exchange without an order book.  Thus, users can exchange different tokens instantaneously with the minimum fees.\n\nIn order to provide its users with seamless integration, Kyber Network runs fully on-chain with 100% transparency.  It is platform-agnostic and compatible with a wide variety of systems that removes integration barriers for different projects.  The possibility to exchange practically any type of tokens opens up a great business opportunity for merchants and brings the blockchain technologies closer to the mass adoption.\n\nThe Kyber Network\u2019s use cases\n\nOn its official website, Kyber Network names the following use cases for its technology.  First, cryptocurrency wallets such as MyEtherWallet, Exodus, Trust Wallet and others can implement this protocol and allow their users to swap tokens without having to leave the application.  Second, decentralized NFTs and Ecommerce platforms can implement Kyber Network to accept payments in multiple cryptocurrencies and receive ethers, DAI or any other tokens that they prefer.  \n\nIn addition, exchanges and trading integrations can write arbitrage programs and take advantage of market inefficiencies.  And finally, Kyber Network helps the industry of DeFi or Decentralized Finance to seamlessly liquidate assets and rebalance token portfolios.\n\nAny project can list their tokens on the Kyber Network.  The only thing that is needed is to fill in the online Google form and provide some basic information about the token and directors/shareholders documents.  Unlike listing on centralized exchanges such as Huobi or Binance, no fee is charged.  However, in order to ensure that the reserve fund can provide the needed level of liquidity, the platform requires uploading an inventory amount of 150 ethers and 150 ETH worth of tokens.  Projects have full control over their funds and can withdraw them at any moment.\n\nHow Kyber Network works\n\nIn order to achieve its goals, Kyber Network implements the following technologies.\n\nThe instant transfer network Kyber Swap makes it possible to conduct instant exchanges of different tokens eliminating the need for order books or deposits.  It makes Kyber Network an ideal tool for merchants who have to make sure that transactions are completed before they send goods to their customers.\n\nThe Kyber Reserve represents the pool where third-parties can contribute tokens and thus provide their liquidity.  The fund is secured via a transparent fund management model which implies keeping records onchain of every trade completed by reserve managers.\n\nKyber Developer is the ultimate set of tools and documentation needed for developers to integrate the protocol into their applications.  \n\nThe Kyber Network\u2019s key milestones\n\nAfter the project was announced in May 2017, its development was very rapid.  The team managed to release the testnet in August of the same year.  The ICO started on September 17th and helped the team raise the hard cap of nearly 49 million USD in Ether in less than 24 hours.\n\nDuring the ICO, 61% of tokens were distributed while the company left 19.5% in the reserve.  The same amount was given away to founders, advisors and seed investors.\n\nThe team went on with their roadmap and released the mainnet in February 2018 to whitelisted participants and on March 19th to the rest of the public in the beta mode.  After the token swap was conducted, KNC tokens can be stored on the wallets that have implemented the Kyber Network\u2019s protocol: KyberSwap, MEW (MyEtherWallet), Enjin, imToken or Easwap.\n\nThe Kyber Network\u2019s competitors\n\nKyber Network is not the only project aiming to conquer the decentralized exchange market.  Among its key competitors are 0x Protocol, IDEX and Bancor.\n\nShapeShift and Changelly also work on providing a crypto swap exchange.  \n\nThe Kyber Network\u2019s team\n\nLoi Luu, the CEO and CoFounder of the project, is based in Singapore and has extensive experience in the blockchain industry.  He has advised a few other blockchain projects including Sygnum and Kambria.  The company itself is headquartered in Singapore as well.\n\nHis partner and the other Co-Founder Yaron Velner is based in Israel and has a Master\u2019s degree in Computer science at Tel Aviv University.  The third CoFounder Victor Tran is based in Vietnam and has great experience in building high-performance multi-platform applications.  He has joined the blockchain industry in early 2016.\n\nAmong the project\u2019s advisors, there are Leng Hoe Long, Kenneth Oh, Prateek Saxena and even the famous founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin.",

    "description": "Kusama is an experimental network launched on August 23rd, 2019.  This is an unaudited trial network designed to be used as a sandbox for developers of another project, Polkadot.  Kusama is aimed to support Polkadot being its experimental version.\n\nKusama and Polkadot: the Peculiarities of Their Interrelations\n\nPolkadot aims to connect different blockchain networks with the final goal to create something like a framework giving an opportunity to make transactions between chains safely.  This is the primary network while Kusama is a testing ground for those investigators who want to have a try in real-world conditions before implementing new technologies and features to Polkadot.\n\nKusama is often positioned as Polkadot\u2019s \u201ccanary network.\u201d This is an allusion to the idiom \u201ccanary in a coal mine\u201d meaning something that warns of possible danger as Kusama was designed to identify all the crucial negative factors before launch and deployment to Polkadot.  In fact, Kusama plays a key role in making Polkadot secure, safe, and stable.\n\nThough both networks are technologically identical, they are not the total analogs.  These are self-sufficient, standalone networks and their priorities differ.  Polkadot embodies stability and security while Kusama prioritizes speed, experimentation, and affordability.\n\nTechnically, Kusama is not a testnet as it functions in the real active environment and its native coin has its own value.  It is more a shadow network or twin network, and its owners state that it will exist while its users maintain it.  They also state that it is highly possible for Kusama to be bridged to Polkadot to achieve cross-network interoperability in the future.\n\nKusama\u2019s Infrastructure\n\nJust like with Polkadot, the principal elements of Kusama\u2019s infrastructure are the Relay Chain, the Parachains, and the Bridges.  The Relay Chain performs as the main chain of the system that provides all the interchain operations and is responsible for the security of the process.\n\nA Parachain is an independent parallel blockchain connected to the Relay Chain.  It has its own structure, logic, currency, its own interactions with third parties.  Each Parachain is maintained by its validators.  A Parathread is a particular case of a Parachain that is different in the method of payment for registration.\n\nA Bridge is a special parachain that is designed to connect a Kusama network to outside services and blockchains.  No third-party services are not required.\n\nKusama Roles\n\nThere are three ways to take part in Kusama\u2019s development.  You can do this as a builder, maintainer, or an end-user.  Builders create parachains and bridges while maintainers keep the system in working order.  There are four main types of maintainers: validators, nominators, collators, and governance participants.\n\nValidators that run the nodes are responsible for maintaining the network and relay chain block production and finalization.  Anyone can become a validator having a required amount of KSM and meeting the minimum requirements for technical equipment.\n\nNominations are the nodes that participate in the staking system.  They select reputable validators and stake KSM increasing the general security of the entire network.\n\nThe collators\u2019 duty is to maintain complete parachains.\n\nGovernance participants determine the direction of network development.  There are three types of governance participants: referendum chamber, council, and technical committee.  The referendum chamber comprises all KSM holders.  Council represents passive stakeholders.  At the time of writing, it consists of 17 members though it is expected that finally there will be 19 of them.  They are responsible for the election of the technical committee.  Their duty is to decide if the proposal is urgent and needs to be implemented rapidly.\n\nThe Peculiarities of Kusama Governance\n\nAny changes to the network can be made via a referendum that can be proposed by all the KSM holders.  To do that, they need to deposit the minimum token amount.  If other participants support this proposal, they put up the same token amount.  \n\nThe proposal supported with the largest amount of deposits will be put to a referendum where any stakeholder can vote for or against it.  The choice is always binary, the voters can say only \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Voting lasts for 28 days.  If the proposal gets approved, the changes enter into force 30 days later.  Another way to start a referendum is to submit a proposal by the majority of the council.\n\nKusama Token\n\nKSM is the project\u2019s native utility token of the network.  Its genesis date is November 28, 2019, but no additional information on the launch, ICO, distribution, or maximum supply is available.\n\nAccording to the project announcements, the tokens can be received in four ways.  If you are a DOT holder, you have a right to claim an equivalent amount of KSM as DOT is a native token of Polkadot.  You can also get KSM through a faucet.  Grants from Web3 Foundation and the bug bounty program are two other ways to obtain this token.\n\nKSM is traded on some exchanges (Bit-Z, CoinBene, BiKi, Huobi Global, etc.).  It cannot be directly bought for fiat, so you need to buy one of the major cryptocurrencies first to be able to purchase KSM.\n\nThis coin is used to maintain the basic project\u2019s functions: participating in governance, supporting new parachains, staking, and paying fees for the messages transmitted across parachains.\n\nKusama on Mars\n\nIn August 2020, Kusama announced an ambitious plan dubbed \u201cKusama on Mars\u201d in cooperation with Robonomics, a member of the Polkadot network.  They aim to transmit blockchain transactions from Mars.  They insist that Kusama\u2019s infrastructure allows implementing this plan.\n\nTeam and Users\n\nKusama was launched by Web3 Foundation, a Swiss company headquartered in Zug.  Some other companies like Parity Technologies are also involved in network development.  There is no information on the project\u2019s team on the official website, but it can be found in social media like LinkedIn.\n\nGavin Wood is the President and Founder of the Web3 Foundation.  He is a prominent personality in the world of blockchain as a founder of a number of meaningful blockchain projects: Ethereum, Polkadot, Parity Technologies, etc.  Before starting the blockchain projects he worked at Microsoft.  Christine Mohan is the CMO at Web3 Foundation.  She is also a co-founder of Blue Firefly Inc.",

    "description": "When the ETHLend platform significantly improved its functionality, it rebranded and got the name of the parent company Aave in September 2018.  The main goal of this project is to build an open and transparent ecosystem with easy services to help people enjoy the benefits of decentralized finance.  Its non-custodial protocol was launched on the Ethereum mainnet in January 2020 and brought multiple innovations to the DeFi space.\n\nAave protocol\n\nThe Aave team changed its strategy from decentralized P2P lending to pool-based one, which makes earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets easier and quicker.  There is a pool contract where users can deposit cryptocurrencies and borrow funds perpetually or in a one-block liquidity way.  Since loans depend on the amount of funds borrowed and the size of the collateral, they do not need to be individually matched, so they become instant.\n\nWhat makes Aave protocol unique is that it allows users to earn interest in real-time because deposits are tokenized as Aave interest-bearing tokens (shortly aTokens) pegged at a 1:1 ratio to underlying assets.  Interest is also paid in aTokens, but they are converted back to the asset when lenders withdraw their funds.\n\nAnother unique feature is flash loans designed for developers who need funds for different purposes while building new tools.  They allow users to borrow cryptocurrency instantly without any collateral.  It is, however, obligatory to borrow, use, and return funds within the same transaction.  The deal is canceled if the borrowed funds are not returned within the block time.\n\nIn spite of that, this outstanding peculiarity drives the usage of the protocol more than anything else.  It makes a big difference for those who want to extract profit-making opportunities within DeFi, and can be used for a variety of purposes, from collateral swaps on Maker to a loan refinancing via dYdX, an open trading platform for crypto assets, and Compound, an interest rate protocol for developers.\n\nOne more outstanding feature of Aave is rate switching.  It allows borrowers to switch between fixed and floating interest rates in order to decrease their borrowing costs and always works in the borrower\u2019s favor.\n\nAll these features including the fact that at the time of writing Aave protocol operates with 16 different assets, make it the most diverse lending pool in the ecosystem.\n\nAave products\n\nThe platform provides users with different products covering such industries as technology, finance, and games.  They include EthLend, Aave Lending, Aave Pocket, Aave Pay, Aave Clearing, Aave Custody, and Aave Gaming.\n\nEthLend is a peer-to-peer lending marketplace running on the Ethereum blockchain, which uses digital tokens as collateral.  If users need money, they take a loan, putting their crypto as collateral, get the liquidity in digital assets, transfer these assets to the IBAN account using Aave Pay and get fiat money.\n\nAave Lending is an efficient SaaS solution for the collateralization of loans.  It makes asset-backed lending business easier for creditors taking care of secure collateral storage, notifications, and liquidation upon margin calls.\n\nAave Pocket is an account innovation, which erases the need for credit cards and bank-to-bank fees.  All transactions stay within the application.  It allows users to store holdings, deposit funds into DLPs and convert drawn funds to their bank accounts.\n\nAave Pay is a service that allows users to take a loan at EthLend and directly send it to their bank account or to cash out their crypto to pay everyday expenses.  This is an attempt to make use of crypto as a real currency for adopters.  It also gives European users the opportunity to pay in fiat using their preferred cryptocurrency.\n\nAave Clearing is a clearing service for businesses and investors who need to convert large amounts of cryptocurrency quickly and efficiently.  The platform helps them to generate quote requests and exchange their cryptocurrencies.\n\nAave Custody stores digital assets for investors.  It is a custodian that follows the highest security standards.\n\nAave Gaming developers aim to create a new gaming experience with the use of mixed reality, Blockchain and Smart Contracts.\n\nAave token LEND\n\nAave token LEND is in the center of the ecosystem.  It is an ERC-20 compatible utility token accepted in all Aave products.  Users can store it in any Ethereum-compatible wallet such as Metamask or MyEtherWallet.  LEND has a total supply of 1,300,000,000 tokens.  1 billion of them were released for public sale and 300,000,000 LEND is held for the development fund.\n \nThe token has different utility functions.  For one, it offers zero-fee lending with LEND.  Then, it provides a 50% discount for fees while 20% of the collected fees are used to reward active users if LEND is used as collateral.  If pledging LEND, the collateral value that users can borrow improves from 65% to 70%.  Next, by sending LEND to the loan smart contract users can defend a collateral call.  Another useful function is that lenders can purchase the preview feature with this token only and see the loans 60 minutes before the public.  Loans featured on the front page can only be paid for with LEND as well.  It is also worth mentioning that ETHLend does not take a 2.5% penalty fee on late penalties.  Finally, 1 LEND equals 1 vote if you want to decide on future developments.\n \nAave team and partners\n \nAt the time of writing, there are 18 people behind this London-based company founded in 2017.  Stani Kulechov is the founder and CEO of Aave.  He is also the Advisor at Delta Exchange.  He has extensive experience in cryptocurrencies, blockchain and fintech space.\n \nOther team members include Emilio Frangella (a full-stack Blockchain developer), Paras Botadra (an IT professional skilled in developing highly integrated and proficient software solutions) and Andrey Kozlov (a full stack developer).\n\nAmong the strategic partners that Aave has gained so far are Sandblock, Eidoo wallet and Cashare, one of the biggest p2p lending platforms.",

    "description": "UNUS SED LEO (LEO) is a utility token issued by iFinex in May 2019.  iFinex is the parent company of the Bitfinex exchange and the cryptocurrency, Tether (USDT).  The UNUS SED LEO token is named after iFinex\u2019s company motto which is a Latin citation from Aesop\u2019s fable, \u201cThe Sow and the Lioness.\u201d  In the fable, the sow brags about her numerous children then asks the lioness how many children she has.  The lioness responds, \u201cUnus sed leo,\u201d which translates to, \u201dOne, but a lion.\u201d\n\nThe LEO token launched on the Ethereum blockchain as well as the EOS blockchain.  The LEO token utilizes a dual-protocol token approach to contribute to the development of blockchain interoperability.  LEO token holders can easily convert between the Ethereum and EOS protocols by using Bitfinex as a bridge between the two blockchains.\n\nUNUS SED LEO token holders receive discounts on trading fees when swapping between cryptocurrencies on the Bitfinex exchange as well as its two cryptocurrency-specific exchanges, EthFinex and EOSFinex.\n\nThe primary purpose of the LEO token is to recoup lost funds.  In 2018, Bitfinex\u2019s payment processor, Crypto Capital, lost $850 million of Bitfinex's funds.  Some have argued (e.g. the New York Attorney General\u2019s office) that Bitfinex subsequently used funds from Tether to secretly cover the shortfall.  \n\nIn an effort to raise more funds, iFinex created the UNUS SED LEO token and conducted a private offering of $1 billion.  During the private sale, the purchase price of the LEO token was 1 USDT for 1 LEO.  In only 10 days, the entire supply of 1 billion LEO tokens were sold. \n\nAccording to the white paper, iFinex and its affiliates will buy back the LEO tokens on a monthly basis at \u201c...a minimum of 27% of the consolidated gross revenues of iFinex from the previous\nmonth, in perpetuity until no tokens are in commercial circulation.\u201d  iFinex also stated in the white paper, they will continue their efforts in recovering the $850 million from Crypto Capital.  If they succeed, they stated that an amount equal to 95% of the recovered funds will be used to repurchase outstanding LEO tokens which then will be burned.  Additionally, LEO tokens used to pay trading fees on Bitfinex will also be burned.  \n\nThe repurchasing and burning of LEO tokens from recovered funds will reduce the token\u2019s total supply and drive the price up through time.  According to Bitfinex, the LEO token was created as a temporary measure.  Over time, the company intends to buy back all LEO tokens in circulation ensuring customers are ultimately refunded.\nIn June 2019, Bitfinex launched a transparency initiative that provides real-time data on all collected platform fees.  In addition, LEO token holders can view and track iFinex revenues as well as LEO token burn quantities.\n\niFinex is headquartered in Hong Kong and registered in the British Virgin Islands.",

This network allows smart contracts on the Ethereum platform to securely connect to external data sources, payment systems, and application program interfaces (APIs) that exist outside the blockchain.\n\nAlthough smart contracts (agreements between two parties written in computer code) have tremendous potential, the underlying consensus mechanisms of blockchain technology make it so smart contracts are unable to communicate with external data systems.  Some smart contracts can\u2019t execute without off-chain information (e.g., a price fluctuation for a specific asset).  To solve this issue, oracles are used.\n\nAn oracle finds and verifies real-world events and submits this data to smart contracts on the blockchain.  Although oracles help, they also present another point of concern: oracles are centralized third-party sources.  A user must trust that the oracle is providing accurate data.  This is called the \u201coracle problem.\u201d\n\nSmartContract (a San Francisco based fintech company) launched Chainlink in June of 2017 in response to the \u201coracle problem.\u201d Originally called SmartContract Oracle, Chainlink is a blockchain middleware that connects smart contracts across blockchains and allows them to access off-chain information from multiple oracles in the network. \n\nInstead of relying on a single oracle to provide smart contracts with external data, Chainlink\u2019s decentralized network of independent nodes can perform computations to determine the accuracy of off-chain data from several oracles before it is passed to a smart contract.\n\nThe ChainLink network uses Link, an ERC-20 token, as an incentive for Node operators to retrieve data from off-chain data feeds, structure data into readable formats on the blockchain, execute off-chain computation, and maintain uptime guarantees. \n\nSmartContract was cofounded in 2014 by Sergey Nazarov (CEO).

    "name": "Loopring",
    "description": "Fueled by a native utility token LRC, Loopring represents a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol providing its users with a tool to exchange cryptocurrencies across different platforms in a secure manner.  The project was launched by Daniel Wang on August 1st, 2017, in Shanghai and since it is open-source, the protocol is available for developers across the world totally for free.  Although Loopring may look like a decentralized exchange at first glance, in fact, it is different as it serves as a connection between multiple exchange platforms, i.e.  it facilitates the exchange process between other platforms including decentralized ones.  \n\nLoopring is blockchain agnostic, which means that it can be integrated with any platform running on smart contracts.  So far, it is compatible with Ethereum, NEO and Qtum.  Among Loopring\u2019s closest competitors, 0x, Bancor, Waves, EtherDelta, Kyber Network, and Blocknet can be named.  However, instead of competing, Loopring seeks to set up partnerships so as to provide all the exchanges with liquidity which all of them need most.\n\nCompared to centralized exchanges, decentralized ones have a very small share of the market.  However, more and more users look towards such types of platforms as they give their users a possibility to fully control their own funds and are less prone to hacks and frauds.  This gives Loopring a good chance to stand out.\n\nThe Loopring technology\n\nUnlike centralized exchanges, Loopring doesn\u2019t require its users to deposit any funds to the platform.  Instead, it gets integrated with wallet addresses directly via private keys.  There\u2019s been a lot of confusion and discussion in the crypto community regarding this aspect, but all their fears are groundless.  \n\nBinding your wallet to Loopring via private keys doesn\u2019t mean uploading your funds to the centralized system.  Loopring simply provides you with an interface to access your funds in the same way as mobile apps grant you access to your bank account.  The funds don\u2019t leave your wallet when you view them through Loopring\u2019s interface.\n\nWhen a user launches an exchange transaction through Loopring\u2019s UI, a smart contract is created on the mainnet and on the off-chain relay nodes.  The smart contract serves to ensure the proper exchange process while the off-chain nodes add the information about the transaction into the public order book and broadcast it to the ring miners.\n\nThe biggest advantage that users get when utilizing such an approach is full control over their funds and orders.  Traders get a chance to change the sum, trim their orders, cancel them or even totally move their funds away from the wallet before the transaction is executed.  Meanwhile, the funds remain on their own wallets and cannot be frozen by any third party.\n\nIn April 2019, Loopring announced implementing the Zero-Knowledge Proofs technology making it possible to process up to 450 transactions per second.  This should help to resolve the ever-lasting problem of scalability since Loopring is still based on Ethereum, and eventually make DEX\u2019s more competitive compared to centralized exchanges.\n\nLoopring mining\n\nLoopring LRC is a mineable token.  It can be obtained on different devices including GPU, CPU and even high-end Linux systems.  The job of miners is to match orders from a huge database represented within the system and to ensure that they are fulfilled.\n\nRing miners get rewarded for their efforts with LRC tokens which serve as an incentive to provide the best exchange rate for traders.  In theory, this should also help to reduce arbitrage opportunities and thus make the trading process fairer as the protocol is designed to find the best rate for switching cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnyone can set up a Ring Node using the open code from GitHub, however, the process is rather complicated and requires some technical skills.  Also, as the network constantly grows, an LRC miner would need a lot of SSD space and CPU cores to install and run a node.  \n\nLRC tokens\n\nLoopring is fueled by a native utility token named LRC.  Its holders earn a percentage of all the fees from exchanges built upon the platform.  70% of all earned fees go as a reward to LRC stakers, 20% is used to fund the Loopring DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and the rest was burned after the ICO.  Neo and Qtum-based alternatives come under tickers LRN and LRQ correspondingly.\n\nThe initial coin offering was launched on August 1st, 2017, and lasted for 16 days.  The team has managed to raise 45 million USD for the future development of the project.\n\nIn order to ensure end-users\u2019 security and prevent malicious DEX\u2019s from harmful actions, Loopring-based exchanges are required to stake LRC to build their reputation.  In case any malicious actions are performed, exchange owners lose some part of their stake.  Also, staking LRC allows exchanges to lower protocol fees and thus attract more users.\n\nIn order to be listed on Bittrex, LRC had to pass the Howey Test and prove that this is not a security token.  In addition to that, LRC can be traded on OKEx, Binance, Bithumb, and many other reputable platforms.  Since this is an ERC-20 token, it can be stored on all Ethereum-compatible wallets, such as MyEtherWallet, Metamask, Coinomi and many more.\n\nThe Loopring team and partners\n\nThe founder and CEO of Loopring is Daniel Wang with a strong software engineering background.  Prior to launching this project, he has co-founded a few other IT projects such as Bitcoin payment processing service Coin Port and Beijing-based Yunrang Information Technology.\n\nHis colleague, Co-Founder and CMO Jay Zhou worked as a Brand Risk Manager at Paypal in 2012-2014.  He acted as a blockchain Advisor for the project ZhongAn Insurance and was also employed at Ernst & Young at the beginning of his career.\n\nAs for the partners\u2019 network, Loopring has managed to set up a collaboration with Berkeley University from California, the Jibrel Network, NEO waller O3, and a few others.",

The Lisk platform is a decentralized application solution written in JavaScript.  At the time of this writing, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language in the world.  By utilizing JavaScript, millions of developers have the opportunity to enter the blockchain space and build, publish, distribute, and monetize dApps on the Lisk platform.  According to the white paper, \u201cDevelopers can quickly deploy their JavaScript apps to Lisk Hosting & Storage Nodes, gain listing in the Lisk Dapp Store, and have immediate access to Lisk Compute Nodes for execution of the code.\u201d  Lisk aims to become the leading platform for decentralized application development in the world.\n\nLisk was founded by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows.  Before Lisk, Kordek and Beddows were actively involved in the development of the open-source blockchain application platform called Crypti (XCR) which was established in 2014.  After some disagreements with where the Crypti project was headed, Kordek and Beddows created Lisk from a hard fork of Crypti in May 2016.  The Lisk team is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland.\n\nUnlike Ethereum where dApps are executed on the mainchain, Lisk runs decentralized apps utilizing sidechain technology.  Sidechains are autonomous blockchains that are connected to the mainchain but don\u2019t impact the performance or speed of the mainchain.  Sidechains give Lisk interoperability features.  For example, users will be able to transfer and swap tokens between the mainchain and sidechains.  Most importantly, sidechains allow developers to completely customize their decentralized applications.\n\nLisk offers a Sidechain Development Kit (SDK) which features an expanding collection of modules for programming a customized decentralized application.  The SDK includes four tools: Lisk Commander, Lisk Elements, Lisk Core, and the Lisk Hub. \n\nLisk allows token holders to register for usernames which are directly tied to a specific account.  Other users can send transactions to the username and the corresponding account will receive it.  Usernames eliminate the need to memorize long account addresses.\n\nLisk employs the delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism which was originally created by the BitShares (BTS) team.  With DPoS, new blocks are verified and created by 101 delegates.  LSK token holders can vote for up to 101 delegates.  The 101 delegates with the most votes are entrusted to validate new transactions on the blockchain.  Lisk rewards block generators with a fixed amount of tokens for each block successfully created and confirmed by the system.  If a delegate misbehaves or doesn\u2019t properly generate a new block, token holders can remove their votes from that delegate and vote for someone else to replace them.  \nIn March 2016, Lisk announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring the blockchain application platform to the Microsoft Azure cloud.  In that same month, Lisk held a public token sale and raised over $5 million.\n\nOn May 24, 2016, the Lisk mainnet was launched.",

Litecoin enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. \n\n The coin is designed for everyday use, pumping out four times as many coins as Bitcoin, in an effort to keep the digital currency from becoming scarce and too expensive. Transactions are also said to be four times faster. There is a limit of 84 million Litecoins. \n\n Litecoin was released on October 7, 2011, via an open-source client on GitHub, under MIT/X11 l\u0456\u0441\u0435n\u0455\u0435\u0455 which are permissive forms of open software licenses with limited restrictions on reuse. The Litecoin Network went live on October 13, 2011, and is described as a fork of the Bitcoin Core client. In addition to trading and purchasing Litecoin, it is possible to mine it, which essentially means providing the network with computational power in exchange for the digital currency. As of 2018, miners were awarded 25 new Litecoins per block, an amount which will get halved roughly every 4 years (every 840,000 blocks). \n\n In May 2017, Litecoin became the first of the top 5 (by market cap) cryptocurrencies to adopt Segregated Witness (known as SegWit), which is a soft fork allowing optimal data transmission while bypassing certain protocol restrictions. This (amongst other things) not only speeds up transactions but allows for larger block sizes. \n\n The currency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee and Engineering Director at Coinbase. Litecoin is his second attempt at a cryptocurrency, having launched one called Fairbrix which didn\u2019t get off the ground due to technical problems. In 2017 Charlie sold or donated all of his Litecoins except for a few he kept as collectibles. He took the decision not to hold a significant amount of the tokens to avoid a conflict of interest. \n\n The Litecoin blockchain is the largest global scrypt based network, operating with 100% uptime since 2011 securing and transacting billions of dollars of value. Scrypt is an algorithm specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory. \n\n Litecoin was created to make mining as accessible and democratized as possible, rather than being monopolized by companies with huge mining capabilities. Since the time between mining blocks is small, more miners have the opportunity to mine blocks and earn mining rewards. At the beginning of 2018, 14,400 Litecoins were being mined a day, the maximum number possible.",

Terra aims to be the go-to decentralized stablecoin used throughout the globe for everyday purchases.\n\nThe Terra project utilizes a two token system: Terra and Luna.  Terra is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to a number of the world's major fiat currencies including the USD, KRW, CNY, GBP, and most importantly, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Special Drawing Rights (IMF SDR).  The IMF SDR is an international reserve asset based on the value of five currencies \u2014 the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, and the British pound sterling.  The Terra token is the unit of account for the Terra protocol.\n\nLuna serves as collateral for the stablecoin, Terra, and provides security and stability to the network.  Terra\u2019s mainnet (which launched in April 2019) is built on Tendermint\u2019s proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  There are one hundred validators who have staked Luna tokens for the chance of securing and processing transactions for the Terra blockchain.  The probability of becoming the next block producer is dependent on the size of the validator\u2019s Luna stake.   Validators are incentivized and compensated through transaction fees and seigniorage (the profit from minting currency).  With all transactions on the Terra network, a small fee is paid to validators.  Fees default to 0.1% and are capped at 1%. \n\nIn addition to staking, Luna is also used to stabilize the price of Terra.  When the price of Terra rises above the target price (e.g., 1 SDR), the protocol must expand its supply, and when its price falls below the target price, the protocol must contract its supply.  Contracting and expanding Terra\u2019s supply means buying or selling Terra at its target price.  In essence, the protocol uses Luna as a market maker for Terra.  To buy 1 Terra, the protocol mints and sells Luna worth 1 SDR.  By selling 1 Terra, the protocol earns Luna worth 1 SDR.  As long as the protocol can maintain both sides of this contract, the price of Terra should remain stable at 1 SDR.\n\nAt the time of writing, the team behind the project is Terraform Labs, a Seoul-based company co-founded by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon.  Before Terra, Shin founded multiple companies including TicketMonster, Fast Five, and FoodFly.  Kwon was a startup founder (Anyfi) and has experience as a software engineer at Microsoft and Apple.\n\nTerra has developed partnerships with over 15 platforms throughout Asia, including industry giants such as TicketMonster (eCommerce, South Korea), Woowa Brothers (food delivery, South Korea), Tiki (eCommerce, Vietnam), and Carousell (eCommerce, Singapore).  Those partners, who together form the Terra Alliance, are interested in incorporating the Terra stablecoin into their businesses.  In total, this alliance has over 45 million users and handles $25 billion in annual transaction volume.  \n\nIn August 2018, four of the largest crypto exchanges - Binance Labs, OKEx, Huobi Capital, and Dunamu (which owns Upbit) - led a $32 million investment in Terra.  Other investors included Polychain Capital, China\u2019s FBG Capital, Hashed, 1kx, and Kenetic Capital among others.  Instead of equity, the deal is a token-based investment round.",

    "description": "MaidSafeCoin is a cryptocurrency focusing on autonomous data, a proxy token created especially for the SAFE network.  The main idea of the SAFE project is creating a decentralized network without data centers, servers, etc.  as a part of the MaidSafe platform, a Scottish technology company founded by David Irvine in 2006.  In fact, MaidSafe aims to create an anonymous Internet.  The abbreviation MAID means Massive Array of Internet Disks, while SAFE means Secure Access For Everyone.\nHow it works\nThe SAFE is a peer-to-peer decentralized data and communication network.  The users can get access to the network via the SAFE Network app, which is available for download on the official website.  It is totally free and gives an opportunity to start MaidSafeCoin mining at once.  The platform is still under development.  At the time of writing, the date of the full launch is yet unknown as according to the official information on the website.\n\nMaidSafeCoin was launched in 2014 as the native coin of the SAFE network to reward users for the system resources they share such as unused hard drive space, bandwidth, or process power.  The reward depends on the system speed, storage space, and the time spent online.  Unlike traditional crypto mining, the system interacts with two types of users: Builders and Farmers.  Farmers store data giving resources to the network, while Builders are the actual network application developers.  The system rewards both groups by giving them MaidSafeCoin tokens.  The core developers can also get coins by error correction and new features development.  The coins may be spent on buying the network products and services with prices set automatically based on user demand and available resources.\n \nMaidSafeCoin is based on the Proof-of-Resource algorithm, which is similar to Proof-of-work.  Simply put, this algorithm checks if Farmers meet the requirements of the Network.  In case they fail to operate at the Network\u2019s standard, their nodes are removed from the Network automatically.\n \nThe MaidSafeCoin token \nAt the time of writing, MaidSafeCoin is an interim digital currency.  It is planned to be replaced by Safecoin as soon as the SAFE network is completely ready.  According to the official SAFE Network website, MaidSafeCoin will be swapped for Safecoin at a 1:1 ratio.\n \nMaidSafeCoin token total supply amounts 452,552,412 tokens and is equal to the circulating supply.  The MaidSafeCoin ICO presale started on April 22nd, 2014.  Although the sale was planned to last for 30 days, the needed result was achieved in only 5 hours after the start helping the team raise 8 million USD in BTC.  During the public sale, only 10% of all tokens were released.  5% more were reserved by the founding development team.\n \nThe options to buy MaidSafeCoin tokens are slim.  MaidSafeCoin is listed on the bitcoin blockchain, and users can buy this cryptocurrency through a few exchanges.  The major part of its trading volume is provided by HitBTC and Bittrex.\nMaidSafeCoin wallet\nThere is no dedicated MaidSafeCoin wallet.  However, tokens can be stored in several ways:\n\nUntil the SAFE network is launched, MAID tokens will be the only unit of currency operating within this decentralized system.

    "description": "Decentraland is an open-source protocol enabling the creation of a virtual reality world. This is a P2P network based on the Ethereum platform that uses the hashing algorithm SHA-256. Decentraland ecosystem is designed for the development and hosting of virtual reality assets on the virtual land acquired by the members of the community. The project was launched in 2015 by the company headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina. \n\nMANA is a utility token in Decentraland that is needed for the purchase of land and interaction with other users of the platform. MANA is not a mineable cryptocurrency, but it can be acquired via token sales and on exchanges. Decentraland also uses ERC-721 LAND tokens received by the users after spending MANA on the purchase of LAND. \n\nThe target market of Decentraland\n\nThough the global virtual reality market size has reached only 10 Billion US dollars at the moment of writing, the experts are sure of its incredible potential. Decentraland wants to participate in the growth of the immersive virtual reality world. Relying on the success of virtual worlds that have created their own internal economies (World of Warcraft, EVE online, etc.), the company brought revolutionary ideas on how communities and publishers should engage online. The users are the owners of their online assets while virtual worlds present the ecosystem that plays a big part in human life. It alleviates numerous social interactions every day changing reality. \n\nDecentraland\u2019s technology\n\nThe platform is decentralized and the world is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. All content that is created by members of the community is recorded in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). As this is not something working from a centralized server, the structure is permanent and no DOS-attack can harm it. It can\u2019t be shut down due to the whims of some entity (a company, or a person), so it\u2019s pretty safe in this respect. \n\nThe platform offers a set of tools for developers enabling assembling and visualization of content. Users employ them to create content and applications while having full control over their ownership rights. They can sell their assets on a special market within the system.\n\nDecentraland\u2019s platform \n\nDecentraland presents infrastructure supporting a shared virtual world called a metaverse. It includes a decentralized ledger for land ownership \u2013 a protocol, which describes the content of each land parcel. Users can refer to the decentralized ledger for proof of ownership. Besides, it\u2019s possible to create attractions on the land and monetize them to earn cryptocurrency.\n\nUsers can\u2019t buy an unlimited amount of land. It\u2019s not allowed to own the land more than 33x33 feet of virtual space at the time of writing. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that there is no limitation to the height of constructions built on the land. It\u2019s possible to arrange neighborhoods or thematic cities in this virtual reality. \n\nIn order to maintain the value of its tokens on sustainable levels, the project burns them after every purchase of land to reduce the amount of circulating supply and thus increase the demand. MANA is an ERC-20 token that is burnt after being used on the purchase of land so that the user could acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. \n\nThere are over 50 themed districts in Decentraland such as shopping districts, a forest, an amusement park, a festival venue, a cyberpunk city, a museum, a university, etc. Cultural and entertainment property makes the infrastructure of the virtual space versatile. There is a map with all the places of interest to explore. \n\nThe virtual society has a strong social basis. The land is contiguous in Decentraland, so its owners have to cooperate with each other. The landowners form the community, working actively together. Adjacent geography creates the imitation of a real world where people can travel and explore the territories either walking or flying across a metaverse. \n\nThe company is planning to invest 5 million USD in blockchain gaming startups. Therefore, it launched the Genesis Content Program enabling the gaming developers to submit proposals for \"blockchain games\" and \u201cinteractive experiences\u201d built on this platform with the native MANA tokens used for games\u2019 monetization. \n\nTo build a blockchain game in Decentraland, developers have to control the land first. Games are hosted on the virtual pieces of property, which means that they have to fit within the boundaries of a given parcel. The room for games is also available and it\u2019s located outside of the virtual city. But the developers will still have to buy the land parcels for hosting and running the games. \n\nDecentraland\u2019s ICO details\n\nDecentraland ICO was launched in August 2017 and ended in less than 24 hours having raised 25 million USD. \n\nMANA received listings on numerous exchanges and continues to develop. One can purchase MANA on Coinbase, Bittrex, Binance and 30+ other platforms at the moment of writing.\n\nAs Decentraland MANA is an ERC-20 token, any wallet suitable for ETH is good for storing it such as MyEtherWallet, Metamask, etc. For higher security, hardware wallets Ledger Nano S and Trezor are good options, too. \n\n40% of tokens were sold to contributors during the token sale. 20% were reserved for content creators and platform developers. 20% of tokens are allocated to the development team and early investors, while the remaining 20% is kept by the Decentraland foundation. \n\nDecentraland\u2019s team \n\nThe founders of the company are Esteban Ordano (CTO) and Ari Meilich. Both have huge experience in the blockchain industry. Prior to Decentraland, they have launched Streamium, which is a blockchain video streaming platform. Esteban Ordano is a co-founder at Smart Contract Solutions. Ari Meilich is a co-founder at Benchrise. He also works as a market research analyst at CRV. \n\nThe website also lists the board of 5 advisors with extensive experience in blockchain and 2p2 networks. \n\nA high-profile partnership with HTC was announced in February 2019. MANA surged by almost 40% after HTC announced the support for its wallet and dApp on the new Exodus 1 blockchain phone. \n\nDecentraland also partners with RNDR that makes the process of rendering and streaming intricate virtual work easier. RNDR enables the distribution and processing of complicated render jobs on a peer-to-peer network.",

    "description": "Matic Network is a scalable blockchain platform with a whole set of products and tools helping developers create decentralized apps.  It implements side-chains for off-chain computation while relying on the Proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and Plasma framework for providing the high level of the platform\u2019s security.  The project has already developed Plasma MVP (Minimum Viable Plasma), WalletConnect protocol, and the Ethereum event notification engine Dagger.  The platform is powered by a utility token under the same name.\nMatic Network explained\nMatic Network names itself a blockchain agnostic Layer-2 scaling solution with the key goal to facilitate scalable, instant and secure transactions on the blockchain.  Initially built upon the Ethereum Network, it adds Plasma-based side-chains on top of it to ensure asset security.  In order to resolve the scalability problem inherent to Ethereum and all its derivatives, Matic Network provides Layer-2 solutions which in theory can help it process 2^16 or near 65,000 transactions per block.  In addition, it eliminates the problem of interoperability via DEXs which would help users change cryptocurrencies based on different blockchains (for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum) directly between their own wallets.\n\nAmong other problems that are inherent to Ethereum-based projects and that Matic plans to overcome are block size limitations, slow block confirmation, and computations issues in smart contract-based blockchain platforms.\n\nFor developers, Matic has designed and rolled out payment APIs and SDKs and a number of other tools helping them create, launch, and migrate decentralized apps built on different platforms.  Matic has also developed its own wallet with a simplified interface that can help its users interact with dApps without having to share their private keys.\nMatic competitors\nMatic Network is not the only project in the blockchain industry to struggle with the scalability issue.  Among its key competitors who develop Layer-2 solutions are Loom Network, OmiseGO, Proof of Authority Network, Lition, Liquid Network, and Rootstock.  A number of projects work on implementing the side-chain solutions, too.  These are the Lightning Network, Raiden Network, Celer Venwork and Liquidity Network.  Cosmos and Polkadot develop a solution for the interoperability problem, and one also should keep in mind EOS, TRON, and Zilliqa that have resolved the scalability problem in their own way and are already widely used by developers.\n\nThe competition is pretty high, however, as Matic has already rolled out some Minimum Viable Products, it has good chances to gain its market share.\nMatic token\nThe platform is fueled by a native ERC-20 token MTX.  This is a utility token and it has the following use cases:\nCovering transaction fees.  Any transactions occurring in the system will require paying the network fee which users will pay with the help of Matic.\nBacking the Proof-of-Stake consensus.  In order to validate transactions, nodes will have to stake MTX in the system.  The rewards for validation will be paid in MTX as well.\nSupporting the Protocol Funding Ecosystem.  For every transaction, a small part of the transaction fee will be sent to the platform\u2019s reserve which is used to support projects improving the Matic ecosystem.\nMatic IEO\nMatic distributed its tokens via an IEO on Binance Launchpad on April 24-26th, 2019.  During the IEO, 1.9 billion tokens were distributed out of the total supply of 10 billion helping the project raise its hard cap of 5 million USD.  The rest of the tokens were allocated for the following purposes:\n\n3.8% - private sale\n16% - team\n4% - advisors\n12% - network operations\n21.86% - foundation\n23.33% - ecosystem\nMatic team\nThe project was founded by an India-based team in 2017.  Jaynti Kanari is the project\u2019s Co-founder and CEO.  He holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree at Dharmsinh Desai Institute of Technology and prior to Matic, he has worked as a Data Scientist for almost 3 years at Housing.com.  \n\nAnother Co-founder and COO of the project, Sandeep Nailwal, holds an MBA in Technology, Finance, and Supply Chain Management from the National Institute of Industrial Engineering, one of the most prestigious educational establishments in India.  He also was a Co-founder at another blockchain project ScopeWeaver.com.  \n\nThe third Co-founder and CPO Anurag Arjun holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Engineering and Computer Engineering at the Nirma Institute of Technology.  Before Matic, he had worked for over three years as AVP (Product Management) at IRIS Business and founded the Dexter Consultancy firm specializing in Management Consulting.",

    "description": "Maker (MKR) is a proprietary utility token for the Maker platform operated by MakerDAO.  It forms the basis of a blockchain-based banking system that simplifies international payments and peer-to-peer transfers.  The main purpose of MKR is to govern the Maker Platform and to maintain the stability of the Dai stablecoin (DAI) through a \u201ccollateralized debt position\u201d (CDP) contract.\n\nMaker targets to reduce volatility\n\nMaker Platform represents a decentralized autonomous organization based on Ethereum and aiming to reduce the volatility of such an unstable cryptocurrency market.  The company reasonably believes that the ever-changing rates of cryptocurrencies are one of the key obstacles preventing them from being adopted at a mass scale.  In order to achieve its goals, Maker creates a set of digital assets linked to real-world assets such as gold, fiat currencies, etc.\n\nWhat makes Maker different\n\nMaker\u2019s key competitors in this niche include Tether which is one of the eldest and most reputable stable coins in the cryptocurrency industry.  Among other stable coins, there are TrustToken\u2019s TrueUSD, USDC issued by Circle, PAX from Paxos and a few more.  All of them have the same flaw - the lack of transparency and true decentralization.  These flaws come from their business models.\n\nFor example, Tether claims that every issued USDT is backed by 1 USD that is transferred from users\u2019 accounts to the company\u2019s financial vault.  However, there is no explanation of how the company manages to cover transaction fees and still support USDT price at a stable level.  In addition, the company has been accused of market manipulations in conjunction with one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges Bitfinex as the opaque model of coins\u2019 issuance leaves a lot of options to play with numbers.\n\nMaker implements a different approach.  It uses Ethereum as collateral and builds its whole system upon transparent smart contracts.  This helps to reduce the necessity of any centralized authorities to audit the money flow as in the case of Tether.  Fiat currencies to back the coins\u2019 supply are not needed either.  Maker relies totally on Ethereum and its smart contracts and represents the truly decentralized and trustless stable cryptocurrency that is resistant to censorship.\n\nThe Maker\u2019s products\n\nOne of the key products issued by Maker is a stable coin DAI.  This coin utilizes the key principles of Maker described above.  Both DAI and MKR coins enable passive income by simply holding the currencies on personal wallets.  Also, holders of MKR get a right to participate in voting for the platform\u2019s improvements continuously suggested by the community members.  Since bad governance leads to MKR price reduction, voters are incentivized to vote only for those proposals that improve the project\u2019s work.  This makes Maker a truly democratic system.\n\nAnother important product developed by Maker is a decentralized exchange Oasis.  Users can connect their personal web-based or hardware wallets to the system and switch cryptocurrencies directly between them without having to upload their funds to any third-party.  At the time of writing, Oasis supports a bit more than a dozen cryptocurrencies each of which can be traded against DAI, USDC, wETH or SAI (an older version of DAI supporting single collateral).\n\nMaker token MKR\n\nMKR is an ERC-20 cryptocurrency which can be stored on any Ethereum-compatible wallet such as Coinomi, Metamask, Trezor or Ledger Nano S.  Initially, the total supply covered 1 million MKR, but some tokens regularly get burned or created according to the prices\u2019 volatility to cover the fees needed for the closure of CDP contracts in DAI and to maintain the stable rate of the latest one.  Thus, the total supply constantly changes as well.\n\nMKR cannot be mined and can only be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as OKEx, BitFinex, KuCoin, Bibox, and some others.  MKR genesis block was issued on November 25th, 2017, without an ICO.\n\nMaker team, partners and investors\n\nThe Maker Foundation which stands behind the project has launched it in conjunction with a few outside partners back in 2014.  It\u2019s headquartered in San Francisco, California, and also has smaller departments across other regions.\n\nMaker\u2019s founder and CEO Rune Christensen operates from Denmark.  His colleague and partner Steven Becker is the President and COO of the organization with robust experience in leading positions at such companies as Penryth Global Securities Lending, Polus Capital, Cubit Capital, and many other financial projects.  Another notable person who has significantly contributed to the project is Phil Potter.  He worked as a COO both at Maker and Tether and stepped down from these positions in June 2018 following allegations of price manipulation involving USDT and BTC.\n\nIn late April 2019, leadership conflicts inside Maker\u2019s team led to multiple departures from key positions.\n\nMakerDAO has gathered a big list of partners having gained the support of many blockchain industry representatives.  Maker\u2019s partners include such projects as OmiseGO, Kyber Network, Digix, Tradeshift, CargoX, and many others.  Among notable investors of MakerDAO are Andreessen Horowitz, Fenbushi Capital, Polychain, IOSG Ventures, FBG Capital and many more.",

Similarly to Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of Bitcoin), the true identity of \u201cMr. Watanabe\u201d is unknown.  \n\nMonaCoin\u2019s proof-of-work (PoW) mining algorithm is designed to be ASIC resistant.  It originally ran Scrypt (just like Litecoin) to fortify itself against ASIC mining but miners figured out a way to build Scrypt-compliant ASICs.  Committed to allowing regular GPUs and CPUs to mine the coin, MonaCoin was moved to the Lyra2REv2 hashing algorithm created by the team behind Vertcoin (VTC).  Monacoin also employs the Dark Gravity Wave v3 algorithm which readjusts its difficulty after each new block (90 second block time).  The total supply of MonaCoin is 105,120,000.  \n\nAlthough the creator of Monacoin is unknown, the project continues to be developed by its community.  MonaCoin was one of the first coins to implement Segwit and has also implemented the Lightning Network on top of the MonaCoin blockchain.\n\nThe MonaCoin Foundation was created in July 2014 by community members who wanted to promote the digital asset in Japan and throughout the world.  According to the website, the primary activities of the foundation are 1) to provide a place where MonaCoin owners can interact with one another and 2) the collection and dissemination of information related to MonaCoin.  Unlike other projects, none of MonaCoin\u2019s developers are members of the foundation.  \n\nIn July 2014, the cryptocurrency was pushed into the national spotlight when Tokyo TV Network, WBS, reported that a man purchased a plot of land in Nagano, Japan with 32,001 MonaCoins and erected a Shinto shrine in honor of the digital asset. \n\nIn 2017, Akihabara (a region known as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest electrical equipment marketplace\u201d with thousands of merchants selling every technological device you can think of) began accepting MonaCoin as a form of payment.  More and more shops and restaurants in Japan have followed suit.\n\nIn May 2018, the MonaCoin blockchain was hacked with a selfish mining attack.  The attacker successfully established a longer chain and caused $90,000 in damages.  \n\nIn the fall of 2018, a hacker stole $134,500 worth of MonaCoin from Monappy, a social media network and web-based wallet.  In March 2019, the hacker was caught by the Tokyo police and was the first person in Japan to be charged with crypto theft.",

    "name": "Nano",
    "description": "Launched on October 1st, 2015, Nano is an open-source cryptocurrency focusing on eliminating the problems inherent to Bitcoin and its derivatives and providing its users with a platform to make fast payments on a peer-to-peer basis.  With its near-instant transactions and zero fees, Nano has managed to overcome the scalability issue that Bitcoin still struggles with.\n\nThe technology underlying Nano is radically different from the one utilized by Bitcoin.  While Bitcoin\u2019s ledger uses the chain of blocks to store the transactional data, Nano relies on the block-lattice data structure where every address in the network has its own blockchain.  Bitcoin is based on the Proof-of-Work consensus which is quite costly and energy-consuming.  Nano eliminates this problem by integrating the Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) algorithm where new tokens are issued by the stakeholders and all decisions are made by voting.\n\nThe block-lattice structure utilized by Nano is a variant of the Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture which is considered to be an alternative solution to the blockchain.  The key difference between these two technologies is related to the way the data is organized.  Instead of creating a sequence of blocks, DAG places nodes according to its own topological order so that all nodes point in the same direction without a chance of a loop.  Graphically displayed, DAG resembles a tree of a flow chart where folders branch into subfolders which in turn divide into smaller units.  \n\nNano is not the only project to implement such a mechanism.  Among its alternatives are IOTA and Byteball.  However, Nano has made a step ahead implementing its own block-lattice structure where each account is linked to a personal blockchain controlled by the private keys known by the account holder.  All accounts in the network are described as \u201caccount-chains\u201d and reflect their balance histories.  Users can update their blocks asynchronously from the main network which allows them not to depend on other participants and instantly verify transactions.\n\nSuch an approach gives a number of benefits.  First, the amount of data that has to be stored in the network is much smaller than what is contained by the Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.  The network only tracks account balances and doesn\u2019t keep the information about transaction amounts.  Second, transactions are verified instantly and with zero fees.  Finally, energy consumption drops dramatically compared to Bitcoin where miners have to spend the lion\u2019s share of their profits to pay electricity bills.\n\nThere is a security concern associated with Nano as well.  Since the network allows conducting instant transactions at zero fees, it can easily fall victim to endless transaction spamming.  The project creators have foreseen this danger and implemented an anti-spam feature based on the PoW mechanism which requires an account to conduct a 5-second work to validate every action.\n\nNano team has developed a dedicated wallet for storing the coins.  It is available for download on their official website and also there is a mobile application.  Nano is supported by a hardware wallet Ledger Nano S which can be used for increased security of your digital possessions.  There are also online wallets on numerous exchange platforms such as Binance, CoinEx, CoinBene, OKEx, Huobi, Kraken and many more where Nano is available for trading.\n\nNano\u2019s Founder and CEO Colin LeMahieu started working on this project in 2014 and rolled out the production network in 2017.  Prior to Nano, LeMahieu has worked as a software developer since 2007 in other companies including Dell, AMD, and Qualcomm which helped him gain a lot of experience in this area.\n\nFormerly known as Raiblocks, the project became the subject of rebranding at the beginning of 2018.  The new name Nano was selected with the goal to represent the simplicity and speed of the project.  Their new logotype is also pretty simple as it consists of several nodes that connect to form an \u201cN\u201d.  This proved to be a reasonable step as the value of Nano cryptocurrency surged by 40% in 24 hours after rebranding was implemented.\n\nDespite all the technical benefits, Nano hasn\u2019t avoided bad incidents throughout its history.  Following the massive hack of Nano tokens from the cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail in February 2018, the platform\u2019s owner Francesco \u2018The Bomber\u2019 Firano was unsuccessfully trying to convince Nano developers to initiate a hard fork so as to reverse the transaction and get the funds back.  This resulted in a $170 million USD lawsuit from Nano investor Alex Brola and a long trial which lasted until October.  It was withdrawn after reaching a confidential agreement with the project\u2019s team.",

    "description": "nCash (NCASH) is a non-mineable utility token that enables data exchange in the Nucleus Vision ecosystem.  The goal of Nucleus is to provide brick and mortar stores the ability to give their offline customers an online customer experience.  Utilizing blockchain and IoT technologies, physical businesses will be able to offer personalized pricing, tailored recommendations, and real-time offers to their customers as they are walking throughout the store.  In addition, customers can also earn nCash tokens each time they visit a store that uses the Nucleus Vision platform.\n\nCustomer data is abundant online which gives eCommerce stores the ability to offer personalized experiences for customers.  For example, if a first-time visitor lands on an eCommerce site, a pop-up can give that person a 10% discount on their first purchase.  If a loyal customer returns to the site, the page can thank the customer by name and recommend new products/services based on their specific purchase history.  \n\nLaunched in 2014, Nucleus Vision aims to bridge the divide between the online and offline retail customer experience.  The foundation of the ecosystem is its patent-pending sensor technology called ION.  Instead of depending on RFID, WiFi, Bluetooth, or even facial recognition technologies, the ION sensor detects customers\u2019 smartphones via radio frequencies when they are within a certain range.  Upon entering a store, the ION sensors will register the customer\u2019s phone and will ask them if they\u2019d be willing to share their information with the store.  If the customer consents, the ION sensors push the data (via Nucleus Vision\u2019s blockchain called \u201cOrbit\u201d) to the Neuron neural network.  The network\u2019s deep-learning algorithms analyze customer data and provide the merchant with real-time customer information (e.g., upcoming life events, purchase history, age, gender, etc.).  \n\nMerchants are required to use nCash tokens to move data throughout the Nucleus Vision network.  In addition, merchants must pay nCash to data providers who give insights about their customers.  To protect user privacy, customers will be able to opt-out of the service at any time.  When users consent to share their information, they will receive nCash tokens which can be used to pay for products and services within the store.\n\nnCash is an ERC-20 token that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nAt the time of this writing, Nucleus Vision claims that they have prototypes running in 10 retail stores in India and that they have signed deals with brands to install their technology in 14,000 more locations in the next few years.\n\n\n\nNucleus Vision was founded by Abhishek Pitti in August 2014.  Prior to Nucleus, Pitti worked as an aerospace engineer.  \n\nThe ICO was scheduled for January 2018 but was canceled because, during the pre-sale, they were able to raise the full amount of the hard cap ($40 million).  The total token supply is 10 billion NCASH.  All tokens will be distributed as follows: 40% goes to public participants, 25% is reserved for the company, 25% goes to the development team and employees, 5% goes to advisors, and the last 5% goes to the bounty program.\n\nThe project has been backed by Tim Draper, IndusAge Partners, among other investors.\n\nAt the time this is being published, Nucleus Vision is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.",

    "name": "NEO",
    "description": "NEO is a non-profit community-driven blockchain platform designed to create a scalable network of decentralized applications (dApps).  Sometimes named as \u201cChinese Ethereum\u201d or \u201cEthereum\u2019s killer\u201c, it was originally launched in 2014, under the brand name of Antshares.  The project rebranded on June 22nd, 2017.  The new name means \u201cnewness, novelty, and youth\u201d in Greek and aims to renew the professional image of this Chinese-based company.  Its dual-layered blockchain was developed by Onchain DNA, a leading blockchain technology company in its region, with a protocol that is said to fix many of Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues.  \n\nA self-proclaimed \u201csmart economy\u201d, NEO uses blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets and automate their management through smart contracts.  Contracts are developer-friendly and use mainstream programming languages, such as C#, Python, Go, and Javascript.\n\nNEO use cases\n\nThe platform NEO can be utilized by developers for a number of purposes.  First of all, it can be used for the creation of digital assets.  With the help of NEO, users are able to convert traditional assets such as real estate and securities into digital form.  Such assets will retain all their characteristics, they will be protected by law with the help of digital certificates and will give their owners much more freedom of operations compared to their real-world equivalent.\n\nAlso, NEO enables the digitization of identity for companies and individuals.  Identities will be protected by a number of multi-factor authentication tools such as face and voice recognition, fingerprints and text messages.\n\nSince NEO poses itself as an alternative to Ethereum, it also implements its own smart contracts that can stand in place of third parties to govern user transactions and thus reduce the necessity of trust between the parties.  What\u2019s special about NEO smart contracts is that they are based on well-known programming languages such as Java, C# and others mentioned above.  This is particularly useful as developers don\u2019t need to learn any new language from scratch as in the case of Ethereum\u2019s Solidity and thus make fewer mistakes in the code.\n\nFinally, NEO gives developers a formed environment for creating decentralized applications or dApps.  On the NEO platform, developers get access to a wide variety of out-of-the-box solutions and tools that significantly facilitate the process.\n\nWhat makes NEO coin different\n\nThis project stands apart from Bitcoin, Ethereum and all their derivatives for a number of reasons.  \n\nFor one, NEO is an indivisible cryptocurrency.  This means that one cannot own or transfer 6.5 or 172.93846 NEO to another wallet as the number should always represent a whole integer.  This may become an issue in case NEO significantly increases in price and would make it difficult to exchange it for any other digital currency.  Exchanges supporting NEO have come up with their own solution to this issue and have made it possible to trade fractions of NEO within their environments.  However, users can only withdraw whole NEO coins to their wallets.\n\nNext, the NEO platform is fueled by the two-tiered system of tokens.  While the ownership of NEO tokens represents the stake in the platform, GAS tokens (or neoGAS) are needed to pay transaction fees.  Such a system may look similar to Ethereum at first glance, however, the core difference is that GAS is generated automatically while holding NEO.  Since NEO is based on the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, holding NEO tokens contributes to the network and helps create new blocks.  For every newly generated block, 8 GAS are distributed across all NEO holders in the proportion relevant to the amount of staked coins.  \n\nThe total supply of both coins is 100 million.  Every NEO token gives its holder the right to manage the network and vote in discussions regarding bookkeeping and NEO network parameter changes.  NEO cannot be mined, because it represents a share of the NEO market and it is technically classed as a security.\n\nFinally, NEO utilizes its own smart contracts that play a role similar to what Ethereum-based smart contracts do, i.e. help participants of any deal exchange value without third-party governance.  But unlike Solidity-based Ethereum, they are created with the help of well-known programming languages that simplify the process for developers\n\nNEO tokens\n\nNEO released its tokens during the public sale which was launched on August 8th, 2017, and ended on September 9th, 2017.  20 million tokens were allocated for the public sale with the total fundraising goal of 5.1 million USD.  The total supply equals to 100 million NEO.\n\nNEO can be purchased on numerous exchange platforms, including such leaders of the industry as BitForex, OKEx, Bitfinex, CoinBene, and BitMart.  The tokens can be stored on desktop and web wallets which are represented on the project\u2019s official website.  A hardware wallet Ledger Nano S also supports NEO, so this can be an option for long-term investors who care for their funds\u2019 security.  \n\nNEO team and partners\n\nSince the community-driven platform targets primarily the internal market of China, not much is known about people standing behind the NEO project.  Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang are proclaimed to be its co-founders, but there is no information about their background available on the web.\n\nIn July 2019, NEO declared its partnership with another Chinese blockchain platform Ontology with the key goal to create an interoperable protocol.  After the platform\u2019s launch, Ontology airdropped 37 million USD worth of its tokens to NEO holders.",

    "description": "Numeraire (NMR) is a decentralized open-sourced ERC-20 utility token developed by the team of crowdsourced quant hedge fund Numerai.  The platform organizes competitions where data scientists create machine learning models based on artificial intelligence for prediction of stock market moves.\n\nThe company Numerai appeared in late 2015 in San Francisco, and then a year later a cryptocurrency NMR was released.  The founder and CEO of the platform is Richard Craib, who was an asset manager when this business idea came to his mind.  He understood that the secret character of data influenced the products they created in this or that way, thus forming a certain financial model.  Therefore, he decided to launch a hedge fund distributing data among its users who can produce models with it and make them work conducting diverse investment strategies.\n\nNumeraire key goals\n\nThe founders of Numerai understand that the strongest machine intelligence can be helpful in a wide variety of applications.  Even the most challenging technical issues such as inefficiency in the stock market become solvable with the enormous potential of these machines.  Numerai launched the project to solve these problems.\n\nThe reason for the inefficiency of the stock market is the lack of open participation.  It may seem that data is more available nowadays to individuals and there are many free data sources.  But it\u2019s impossible to build an effective model with publicly available data, while high-quality stock market data is well protected by data monopolies and hedge funds.  These entities don\u2019t want to part with something that provides a competitive edge for them.  Under such circumstances, only a small group of people have access to valuable data which makes breakthrough achievements and progress towards more efficient markets almost impossible.\n\nThese people used to hide the methods, techniques, and data of an efficient financial model that they\u2019ve developed due to the strong financial incentive for secrecy.  This doesn\u2019t let them improve their work.  But there\u2019s a way to share the data with other machine learning experts using cryptography methods.  Numerai platform enables that, providing the possibility to work jointly over the problem, attracting the best minds in the sphere with their unique approach to issues.\n\nNumerai technology\n\nWhat is interesting, the whole project is a confluence of technologies that didn\u2019t even exist some time ago in cryptography and artificial intelligence.  Now, the machine learning models, which were trained on data from blockchain-based marketplaces can employ their huge potential to develop the most powerful AIs.  The use of private machine learning helps to use sensitive private data without revealing it.  As a result, it\u2019s possible to sell the data, keeping it private on the open marketplaces.\n\nThe system is powerful thanks to the possibility to attract the best data globally that is coming from thousands of sources, create open competition between models and algorithms providing also transparency in rewards.  At this, privacy is preserved at all stages.  Secure computation becomes possible to such technologies as homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and secure multi-party computation (MPC) and Truebit protocol for verification.\n\nA special mechanism was developed by the Numeraire team to allocate the prize pool among the participants who submit their bids.  It is based on a multi-unit Dutch auction with several new rules added.\n\nHow Numeraire works\n\nThe platform arranges competitions among scientists on a weekly basis.  During these competitions, scientists obtain access to updated data and try to create financial models using encrypted data sets.  The results are uploaded to the platform.  Then the testing period follows when all the models devised are tested in a real-world environment and 100 best models are selected from them.  The winners are rewarded with bitcoins.\n\nThe participants should stake a certain amount of NMR for the prevention of tampering.  Those who devised successful models will get the staked amount back together with the BTC reward.  The scientists who lost, lose their stakes as well, and their NMR tokens are burnt.\n\nPaying the stake, the data scientists express their confidence in the model they offer.  There is a staking prize pool in every tournament.  The best models submitted by the data scientists are combined into a tradeable \u201cmetamodel\u201d.  Only those who created highly effective models get payment.\n\nNumerai tokens\n\nThe exchanges trading NMR include such platforms as Upbit, Yobit, Bittrex, etc.  As this is a token made on the Ethereum platform, so it\u2019s possible to store NMR on any Ethereum-compatible wallet.  As for the hardware wallets, Ledger Nano S and Trezor are recommended as the most reliable ones.  The desktop alternatives include Exodus and Mist.  Those who need a web wallet should select MyEtherWallet.  ETHAdress is the right option for a paper wallet.\n\nThe project had no ICO.  The distribution of 1 million NMR tokens took place on February 21, 2017.  The recipients of tokens were 12,000 community members who were participants of the competition and whose models performed well.   \n\nMax supply for NMR equals to 21 million tokens.  The founders of the project have no intention to sell tokens to prevent speculators who are not going to use the tokens.  After the initial distribution, a certain number of Numerai is minted on a weekly basis until the max supply is reached.\n\nIt is possible to earn Numeraire tokens only by staking NMR.  The total amount of earnings on the platform surpasses 140,000 USD per month thus turning this enterprise into the most well-paid data science tournament in the world.  One can also earn Numerai reporting vulnerabilities, contributing to open-source packages such as Numerox and performing other tasks, for instance, translating technical documents to other languages.\n\nNumeraire team\n\nRichard Craib, the founder of Numerai, was named \u201cForbes 30 under 30\u201d awardee in 2017.  The members of the directory board are Georey Bradway and Xander Dunn.  The advisors of the platform are also famous figures in the cryptocurrency world such as Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, Polychain capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee and Ash Fontana, a board member at Kaggie.",

According to the website, \u201cthe mission of NPXS is to enable digital currencies to be more accessible to more people across the borders and further increase the utility of digital currencies.\u201d  To accomplish this, Pundi X has built an ecosystem including hardware equipment and software products to help physical retail stores to buy, sell, and accept cryptocurrency. \n\nThe primary hardware product is the Pundi XPOS, a blockchain-enabled point of sale (PoS) device for merchants which can facilitate crypto payments and transactions through mobile wallets.  In addition to processing transactions, Pundi XPOS has its own app store where developers can create applications (such as wallets, insurance services, loyalty programs, retail intelligence, order management, and inventory management systems) for retailers to grow their businesses.  NPXS tokens are required to publish an app on the Pundi XPOS app store.  \n\nThe company plans on rolling out a minimum of 100,000 XPOS units to the global retail market by February 2021.  According to the company, the PoS device has already been shipped to over 30 countries including Australia, Colombia, France, Korea, Switzerland, South Africa, Taiwan, United States, and Uganda.  \n\nThe Pundi X team has also created XPass, a \u201csmart card\u201d where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies with a swipe.  With XPass, users can also make purchases at retailers that have the Pundi XPOS system.  The team plans on incentivizing participation in the Pundi X network by offering free XPOS systems to retail stores in select countries. \n\nThe project is backed by the Singapore-based company, Pundi X Labs.  The company was co-founded by Zach Cheah (CEO), Pitt Huang (CTO), and Danny Lim (CFO) in 2017.  Before Pundi X, Cheah spent 12 years in the browser and mobile gaming market, Huang started and sold several startups including a Groupon-like company at the age of 25, and Lim was a product designer with Baidu and Lenovo.\n\nIn January 2018, Pundi X held an ICO for their first token (PXS) and raised $35 million USD.  In the middle of 2018, the project transitioned to the NPXS token. Until September 2018, token holders could swap 1 PXS for 1,000 NPXS.\n\nNPXS is an ERC-20 token utilizing the Ethereum blockchain.",

Also, it aims to make it possible for others to create their own blockchains and tokens that they desire.  The key goal of NULS Foundation is to make the use of blockchain safer and easier for people.  The project was founded in 2017 and the company which it represents is located in San Jose, California.\n\nThe NULS technology\n\nThe company operates with different technologies that allow people to conduct secure transactions and provides modules to create custom cryptocurrencies and other useful products.  NULS uses modular architecture as one of its core technologies.  What makes it special is that a person can replace any chosen module or add one without impacting the whole system.  It makes work much easier and comfortable.\n\nAnother important technology the company uses is PoCM (Proof of Credit Mining).  It is a platform that lets projects distribute project tokens on blockchains using smart contracts.  It is a risk-free technology as tokens never leave users\u2019 wallets.  Moreover, individuals can mine tokens even while their devices are turned off.\n\nSmart contracts are a part of NULS as well.  They are computer protocols that verify the performance of a contract and allow transferring funds without the governance of any third parties.  This technology provides additional security and reduces transaction costs.  It is implemented in many cryptocurrencies and NULS did not miss out on it as well.\n\nNULS products\n\nThe goal of the company is to make it possible to create your own cryptocurrencies and tokens without any need to know how to code.  The products represent different modules that help individuals create their own blockchains without any basic knowledge.\n\nNULS ChainBox is an out-of-the-box way to build the blockchain.  It provides users with 6 different modules that help them create tokens without any coding skills.  Using the following product, enthusiasts can choose what kind of blockchain they would like to create and ChainBox makes it happen.\n\nChain Factory helps you build blockchains.  It has a user-friendly graphical interface that guides you throughout the way of making tokens.  NULStar is a micro-service management platform which can be used in projects with the same micro-service architecture as their main framework.  NULS Cross-Chain allows users to transfer assets from Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin and other blockchains to NULS blockchain.  Using various technologies it has a very high speed and security.\n\nThere is also a NULS wallet developed by their team.  It is a light wallet where its users can receive rewards even while their computers are switched off.\n\nNULS token and ICO details\n\nThe NULS token is an ERC-20.  The ICO was conducted in 2017, but there is no information available on the web about the amount of raised funds and distributed tokens.  The tokens themselves can be used for trading on different markets such as Huobi, BitZ, Dragonex and many more.\n\nThere was an airdrop on the Binance exchange in November 2017.  40 million of NULS tokens were distributed among users and the coin became tradeable in December of the same year.  \n\nSince NULS token is an ERC-20 type it can be stored on any Ethereum blockchain-based wallets, like MyEtherWallet, MetaMask and on a special wallet made by the NULS foundation.\n\n\nNULS team and partners\n\nThe company has dual headquarters in Chongqing, China and San Jose, California with a team of professionals with years of experience in the blockchain industry.\n\nReaper Ran is the CMD(Community Management Director) and the co-founder of NULS.  Niels is the director of technology in this huge company.  There are also many other members who are architects, designers and marketing managers.  However, since the project is based in China and focuses primarily on the inside market, there is practically no information on its members available on the web.\n\nThe company has a lot of partners including BlockGroup, BitMain, Prism, Nabox and many more in different areas.",

    "description": "OmiseGO (OMG) aims to become a decentralized, universal payment processing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.  The OmiseGO platform is powered by the OMG token and will allow people, businesses, and organizations to send and receive payments in digital currencies as well as fiat.  In effect, OmiseGO hopes to replace legacy payment systems like SWIFT, ACH, and Western Union.  According to the website, the mission of OmiseGO is \u201cto enable people to securely access financial services, invest, exchange and spend digital assets anytime, anywhere.\u201d  \n\nThe OmiseGO project was founded in 2017.  The company behind OmiseGO is Omise, a payment gateway provider headquartered in Thailand.  The team is led by Jun Hasegawa (CEO).  Before Omise, Hasegawa was a Director at Alpha-do Inc and the co-founder and CEO of LIFEmee Inc.  Since 2013, Omise has been facilitating cross-border payments in six Southeast Asian countries.  Omise is also a payment processor for Alipay, which at the time of this writing is the world\u2019s largest mobile payment platform in the world with over 1 billion users.  \n\nOmiseGO\u2019s list of advisors includes some of the biggest names in the cryptosphere including Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum), Gavin Wood (also a co-founder of Ethereum), Roger Ver (Executive Chairman of Bitcoin.com) Julian Zawistowski (Director of the Golem Foundation), and Joseph Poon (co-creator of the Lightning Network).  \n\nOmiseGO is building a second layer blockchain on top of the Ethereum network using Plasma architecture.  Plasma is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum that provides a framework for building \u2018off-chain\u2019 decentralized apps that are fast, secure, and scalable.  The OmiseGO ecosystem will consist of a decentralized exchange, liquidity provider mechanism, clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway.  With these features, developers can create dApps that offer services like payments, remittances, loyalty programs, and much more.\n\nOmiseGO was created to solve the fragmentation and centralization problems found in the payment processing industry.  Countries have different regulations and many payment processors are incompatible with their competitors which makes it difficult for ordinary people to send value across borders.  In addition, because these payment processors are centralized, they are vulnerable to hacks.\n\nThe ultimate vision of the OmiseGO platform is to launch its own mainnet and allow users to send, receive, and exchange all cryptoassets as well as fiat currencies.  OmiseGO is creating a white-label software development kit (SDK) that will allow businesses and organizations with a unit of value (e.g., reward points, fiat currency, cryptocurrency) to create their own branded wallets which will interact with the OmiseGO platform.  It is also creating a non-custodial decentralized exchange that will facilitate the swapping of the asset by bonding ETH to a smart contract.  For example, if Bob wants Alice to send him Yen but Alice only has US dollars, Alice can send Bob the US dollars using the OmiseGO platform and the decentralized exchange will automatically swap the USD to ETH, then the ETH will be swapped for Yen.  Now that it is in the currency that Bob initially requested, the money will be sent directly to Bob.\n\nThe settlement and clearing of transactions will occur on the OMG blockchain.  The underlying Ethereum blockchain will only be utilized to record the blockchain state.  This configuration allows the project to (theoretically) adopt cross-blockchain compatibility at the second layer.  According to the white paper, Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like systems will be allowed to trade on the OMG blockchain \u201cvia a clearinghouse network on the Lightning Network.\u201d\n\nThe project uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.  Validators must stake OMG tokens in order to have a chance of verifying new blocks.  The validators earn fees from validating the activity of the blockchain.  If a validator behaves improperly, including deviating from consensus rules, their staked tokens will be burned on the OMG blockchain.  All OmiseGO validators must also run a full Ethereum node since staked OMG tokens are stored on the root chain.\n\nIn July 2017, the project canceled its public ICO because they reached their fundraising goal of $25 million during the pre-sale.  Following the pre-sale, a total of 140.2 million OMG tokens were created.  91.3 million (65.1% of total supply) were distributed to participating investors.  28.0 million tokens (20.0% of total supply) were allocated to OmiseGO for the continued development of the platform.  Team members received 13.9 million (9.9% of total supply) tokens.  The allocations to the project and the team members were subject to a one-year lockup period.\n\nIn September 2017, OmiseGO conducted an airdrop.  Anyone holding a minimum of 0.1 ETH could receive a portion of an OMG token for free.  A total of 7 million tokens (5% of total supply) were given away for this airdrop. \n\nIn April 2019, OmiseGO announced the public Alpha release of the OMG Network on the Ethereum test net.  The project claims they have been able to process millions of transactions with a peak throughput of over 2,700 transactions per second.  At the time of this writing, the Ethereum blockchain supports roughly 15 transactions per second.",

Ontology offers several distributed services including data exchange, data collaboration, digital identity authentication, blockchain creation, smart contracts, security protocols, and software development kits (SDK) among others.\n\nOntology was created in 2017 by the Shanghai-based company called OnChain, which is led by co-founders Erik Zhang, Jun Li, and Da HongFei.  Before creating Ontology, OnChain founded the NEO blockchain (formerly called Antshares) in 2014.  At the time of this writing, NEO is a top 20 cryptoasset ranked by market cap.\n\nOntology started off as a NEP-5 token on the NEO blockchain (which is comparable to an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain) but moved to its own blockchain in June of 2018.  Despite sharing the same parent company, Ontology and NEO are independent projects with different goals.  That said, the two projects have collaborated on building and promoting a NEO smart contract ecosystem.\n\nOntology employs a dual token system that consists of the ONT staking token and the ONG utility token.  ONT is used to stake and secure the blockchain while ONG is used to pay for token transactions, network storage, and the execution of smart contracts.  ONT tokens release ONG tokens which means ONT token holders will periodically receive ONG tokens.\n\nOntology\u2019s consensus mechanism is called VBFT, which combines three different consensus protocols: proof-of-stake (PoS), Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT), and Verifiable Random Function (VRF).  Users who wish to stake ONT are required to set up a node on the Ontology platform.  In return for staking their ONT tokens, stakers receive a portion of network, storage, and smart contract execution fees.  ONT holders are able to vote on major upgrades and proposals for the Ontology network.\n\nInstead of an ICO, in March 2018, Ontology gave away ONT tokens to their email newsletter subscribers and airdropped ONT tokens to NEO token holders.  In the end, 20 million ONT tokens were distributed to the community.\n\nThe max supply of ONT is 1 billion.  Each ONT token is indivisible and all were mined in the genesis block.  The max supply of ONG is 1 billion as well and is divisible to nine decimal points.",

The company promotes the PIVX coin as a cryptocurrency with the functionality of Bitcoin, but with a higher level of privacy and higher speed of transactions.  \n\nPIVX is a fork of another privacy coin Dash that was created in February 2016.

It also employs such technologies as PrivateSend, InstantSend, Dandelion protocol, bulletproofs, I2P network integration and other innovative technologies to attain these goals.   \n\nPIVX key goals\n\nThe team behind the project believes that privacy is a non-negotiable basic human right.  Taking into account that technology is getting improved, governance should also advance, so the platform invites all those who share such principles to join the community and develop it together.  \n\nThe PIVX team also tries to improve platform scalability and make it easy to use.  It aims to make the assets more fungible and widespread to enhance its application as a usual payment method all over the world.  The PIVX platform tries to acquire popularity with its ultra-fast transactions, little fees, a high level of anonymity and privacy.   \n\nThe roadmap of the company is very detailed with all nuances of the future protocols and features for future realization.  It also includes the status bar pointing to the stage of development such as planning, development, testing and complete.  It helps the users to be aware of all works conducted by the team, the current status of their implementation and the short-term goals it tries to attain.  \n\nThe PIVX technologies\n\nBeing the aggregate of famous cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Dash, and Litcoin, PIVX was developed to get rid of the weak points that are found in all these coins.  The untraceable zPIV and Zerocoin protocols make the coin special, too.\nThe team has developed its version of Zerocoin Protocol and named it zPIV.  It is a combination of Zerocoin and Proof-of-Stake.  PIVX was the first coin that employed the Zerocoin protocol, having started developing zPoS (Privacy-enabled Proof-of-Stake technology), which guarantees absolute privacy not only for transactions but for the wallet balances, too.  In this way, the platform introduced privacy to the PoS consensus mechanism, which is also more energy-efficient than PoW because mining is not necessary for the generation of coins.  The main benefit of Zerocoin protocol is the use of zero-knowledge proofs that enable verification of transactions without revealing info about them.  \n\nPIVX network offers the CoinJoin feature with the same functionality as PrivateSend, which is a decentralized mixer that erases the history of the coin.  Technically, the PrivateSend feature was based on CoinJoin technology.  The transactions are obscured with the help of a coin mixing scheme so that transactions can\u2019t be traced back to their sources.  \n\nThe platform also employs the SwiftX mechanism to contribute to the reliability and speediness of transactions.  The functionality of this feature is similar to what InstantSend (a feature of DASH cryptocurrency) does.  SwiftX employs the masternodes by quorum consensus to deliver immediate transactions.  \n\nThe PIVX network\n\nThe use of Proof-of-Stake consensus makes the platform immune to 51% mining attacks, which become technically impossible due to the inability to use ASIC mining devices.  The PoS model also helps end-users to participate in mining as they can employ consumer-level hardware equipment for that.  \n\nThe products of the PIVX team also include the decentralized exchange zDEX.  The exchange doesn\u2019t require ID verification, and users don\u2019t have to comply with AML and KYC requirements.  The platform runs on the Masternode tier of the PIVX network.  \n\nAnother product developed by the PIVX team is a digital wallet PIVX Core.  It is used for storing PIVX coins The wallet supports PIV and zPIV coins and allows conversion from zPIV to PIV.  It\u2019s also possible to stake through the interface of the wallet.  It\u2019s enough to hold tokens on the wallet of the platform to get passive income.  The advanced PoS algorithm makes it possible to use the PIVX wallet on any device regardless of the operating system and technical specification of the device.  \n\nThe person who stakes 10,000 PIVX as collateral is able to host the Masternode, which can also become a source of passive income.  With Masternodes, the network acquires better privacy, decentralized budgeting system, proposal and voting system and other features making the network unique.  Masternode holders obtain block rewards for network uptime and hosting.\n\nFinancial details\nThe project was self-funded and held no ICO.  16,67% of the block rewards go to masternodes and staking of PIVX.  PIVX doesn\u2019t have a hard cap meaning there\u2019s no coin supply limit.  However, the blockchain is developed to limit the growth and balance the network by burning the coins.  It\u2019s possible to buy PIVX on such exchanges as Kucoin, Bittrex, Binance, FEX, Bithumb, and many others.  \n\nThe PIVX Team\n\nThe founder and CEO of the company is James Burden, an IT infrastructure expert with a nickname \u2018s3v3n h4cks\u2019.  He was also appointed as Chief Blockchain Advisor to the Observer Foundation (OBSR).  The project was initiated by him and another co-founder with the alias \u201cCoin Server\u201d but later the development was delegated to the community as it is an open-source project.  \n\nThe founders of the platform believe in the power of individuals therefore the community governance was chosen.  It means that the project doesn\u2019t have a core team or any specified leaders.  Though the website provides the names of leading developers, numerous contributors build the platform together.",

    "description": "Power Ledger is a blockchain-based platform that aims to solve different problems with energy and is fueled by a native utility token POWR.  The project was launched in May 2016 by 2 entrepreneurs Jemma Green and Dave Martin and is still perfectly fulfilling its tasks.  The main goal of this platform is to make it easier and cheaper to choose energy from renewable resources for end-users.  Energy markets cannot keep up with the latest advancements in solar technology, so POWR stands forward to do this job for them.  \n\nThe market is fueled by 2 cryptocurrencies, POWR and Sparkz.  POWR tokens allow hosts to interact with the ecosystem and offer them protection with the help of a special Smart Bond technology.  These tokens can also be exchanged for Sparkz which in their case may be used for transactions in the energy exchange market.\n\nPower Ledger technology\n\nNowadays, energy markets cannot distribute and control energy management mechanisms on a good level so Power Ledger has invented its own method to make everything mentioned above happen.  They see blockchain as a possible savior of electricity distribution and wisely use it.\n\nProject's technology works in three different markets: Energy trading, environmental commodities trading, and renewable asset ownership.\n\nThe energy trading software developed by Power Ledger can be used to buy and sell energy in real-time from any part of the world.  With this software, all transactions are safe and fair since they are protected by blockchain technology.\n\nUsing the Power Ledger technology you can commit environmental commodities trading in a more transparent, safe and overall productive way.  Thus, POWR can be used to track energy from renewable resources and offset emissions.\n\nMoreover, the technology used in renewable asset ownership which activates more renewable assets and makes more green energy available.\n\nPower Ledger products\n\nAt the time of writing, the project has 22 products in 8 different countries all around the world.  Among the most successful ones are the following.\n\nThe first project is called Powerclub and is located in Australia.  It is an Australian national energy retailer that provides Virtual Power Plant functionality to customers in South Africa.  The platform facilitates the physical dispatching of stored energy while there are high price intervals using blockchain technology.\n\nAnother project Alperia SpA is located in Italy.  Alperia is a huge green energy provider with a lot of loyal customers.  The blockchain technology of Power Ledger is going to be used to increase the variety of services offered to Alperia\u2019s customers.  With its help, Alperia will be able to offer such services as energy trading and origin verification.\n\nOne other project is called M-RETS and is located in North America.  It is a blockchain-enabled REC marketplace and it tracks generation from renewable resources around North America and serves as a trusted gateway to environmental markets.\n\nThe POWR token\n\nThe token of Power Ledger is one of the main aspects maintaining the ecosystem of the whole project.  It was officially distributed via private sale on the 27th of July 2017.  The official public sale was conducted from September 8th until October 6th of the same year with 150 million more POWR offered.\n\nIt is an Ethereum-based token that is implemented into the core of the Power Ledger.  Since it is an ERC-20 type it can be stored on wallets only with ERC-20 support, such as MyEtherWallet, Metamask, Coinomi or Ledger Nano S.\n\nPOWR tokens can be exchanged into Sparkz which is the second token within the ecosystem that the project depends on.  Unlike POWR, this one can be used for transactions in the energy exchange markets protected by blockchain.\nPower Ledger team and key partners\nDr. Jemma Green is the executive chairman of the project.  She set her career plan quite early, completed a Ph.D. in electricity market disruption and then became a researcher at Curtin University.  Jumping to the year 2016, she cofounded a blockchain project called Power Ledger.\n\nJohn Bulich is a technical director and another co-founder of this massive project.  He develops strategies for further improvement of Power Ledger and stands at the top of the technical team to develop the project even further.\n\nPower Ledger also has a US registry M-RETS partnered with them.  Power Ledger has partnered with the following registry to organize a REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) marketplace in the United States.\n\nAnother key partner is the Italian green energy firm called Alperia.  This partnership allows the Italian company to use the blockchain solutions of Power Ledger to experiment with new possible services such as energy trading and origin tracking.",

    "description": "Qtum is a cryptocurrency fueling the Qtum blockchain which was developed on the Ethereum platform.  It\u2019s a hybrid of two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as it merges the popular design aspects of them both.  \n\nQtum is technically a fork of Bitcoin Core version 0.13 with the integrated element of the Ethereum virtual machine which executes the smart contracts on the platform.  The project was launched because the public blockchain developers were so dissatisfied with existing choices that they started seeking an alternative.  It combines the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain technologies and eliminates their flaws.  Qtum borrowed security from Bitcoin and smart contract functionality from Ethereum.  \n\nQtum is financed by the company Quantum Foundation headquartered in Singapore.  The project was launched in March 2017.  \nThe Qtum platform\nQtum is an open-sourced decentralized smart contract platform.  The main goal of Qtum is to provide convenient and simple tools for companies to create decentralized applications while ensuring high network security and reliability.  \n\nThe first focus target of the project are applications for finance, the Internet of Things, and supply chains.\nThe Qtum technology\nThe Qtum cryptocurrency is based on the BTC transaction model, but the consensus represents an upgraded version of Ethereum\u2019s technology.\n\nThe developers improved the consensus of PoS and adopted MPoS (Mutualized Proof Of Stake) to prevent the harm that might be inflicted by malicious nodes.  The Bitcoin core code supports the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model with Account Abstraction Layer (AAL) providing integration of Ethereum virtual machines and supporting smart contracts.  Despite the apparent simplicity of operations for sending QTUM to other contracts, it\u2019s worth noting the complexity of the AAL that allows adding new virtual machines, for instance, x86 VM.  \n\nQtum doesn\u2019t use masternodes and every Qtum core wallet is a decentralized full node.  There are more than 3000 nodes globally at the time of writing located in over 60 countries, with about 30% of them in South Korea and the USA.  \n\nThe Qtum cryptocurrency is mainly used in Asian markets, therefore it is often exchanged to such fiat currencies as the yuan and the South Korean won.  BTC and ETH are the most frequent cryptocurrencies involved in exchanges.  \nQtum ICO\nThe funding was raised in several rounds.  The seed round took place on January 11, 2017 with 9 investors among Qtum blockchain angels.  1 million dollars was raised to prepare the infrastructure for sale of tokens in a public ICO, or public sale of tokens to investors.  \n\nICO was launched on March 17, 2017, during the amount equal to 15,600,000 USD was raised in 117 hours.  The project became record-breaking as by that time it was the fourth most-funded cryptocurrency crowdsale ever.\n\nThe Qtum token sale was launched during ICO on 6 cryptocurrency platforms with ETH and BTC accepted as the main means of payment.  The project raised 11,156.766 BTC and 77,081.031 ETH in exchange for the 51 million Qtum tokens distributed to the public.\n\nThe grant round was arranged on December 19, 2018, during which 400,000 USD was raised.  The project founders have awarded an R&D grant to the team of academics at Columbia University to fund the development of a new programming language named DeapSEA for Ethereum-style smart contracts and its further integration with ETH smart contracts.\nThe Qtum tokens\nThe Qtum tokens were distributed in the following way:\n51% of QTUM was distributed via crowdsale with the funds used for financing marketing, development, and covering administration costs\n29% of tokens were distributed to community initiatives (R&D, education, expansion of market)\n20% of QTUM tokens were allocated to the founders, backers, and developers.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is available for exchange and sale/purchase on Hong Kong Bitfinex platform.  The operations for the exotic QTUM/KRW pair are available on the South Korean platform Coinone.  Among other big platforms supporting Qtum are Binance, CoinEgg and Cat.Ex.\n\nThe Qtum developers provide the official Qtum core wallet and support Qtum QRC20 tokens and smart contract transactions.  There are also 3rd party QTUM wallets that may feature limited functionality.  The users can resort to Atomic wallet, Jaxx Liberty wallet and Bitpie wallet to store their digital assets on them.  Those who need hardware wallets, Ledger and Trezor can serve as an alternative.\nTeam\nThe team wanted to bridge the gap between the communities of both cryptocurrencies.  For this reason, it\u2019s only natural that the Quantum team includes people who worked over the development of the Bitcoin and ETH platforms.  They also worked with top companies such as Alibaba, NASDAQ, Baidu, and others.  \n\nFor instance, Patrick Dai, the key person in the team, used to be working at Alibaba before.  Now he is a co-founder of the company along with Jordan Earls.  The project is supported by numerous significant figures in the sphere of blockchain venturing investments, for example, Roger Ver who helps many Bitcoin startups, Xu Star, OKCoin founder, and others.  The executives of big Chinese companies also invest in this company.  \n\nIn addition, Qtum partners with PwC Asia, which provides accounting services for the project.",

    "description": "Reddcoin is a decentralized blockchain-based project, which has found its own way to become notable among other numerous cryptocurrencies.  Reedcoin offers the services of social currency that improves people\u2019s social presence and makes the digital currency more understandable and useful for people who are not deeply involved in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nRDD as a social coin\n\nSocial media is a big business, and the better part of the adult population is its active participants.  The evolution of social media platforms has been speedy, but there are some human activities that are not properly organized on those platforms.  The reward for content is an example of this.\n\nNow everyone may become a social media influencer and get paid for the content with the help of socialcoins such as RDD.  ReddCoin creates a system of tipping with a peer-to-peer payment structure which enables sending and receiving money in RDD coins on social networks as a reward from readers without transaction fees.  Looking forward, RDD is meant to substitute \u201clikes\u201d retaining the evaluation function.\n\nHow Reddcoin works\n\nIt is not difficult to start getting tips.  If content creators want to turn their \u201clikes\u201d, \u201cretweets\u201d, and \u201chearts\u201d into money, they need just to register with the ReddID browser extension and get a personal name linked to the wallet address.  ReddID is a blockchain-based naming service that lets users connect their usernames with social network identities.  And if you wish to stimulate your favorite author with coins, you are just to click the button \u201ctip\u201d under the post.\n\nBy contrast with basic social media that require the usage of their own platforms for sending or receiving money, Reddcoin allows integrating their payment functions simultaneously into a number of platforms such as Reddit, Twitch, Justin.tv, Twitter, etc.  The project aims to partner with Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.\n\nIt is also possible to use Reddcoin for purchasing items on websites and playing games, as well as for staking.  If a user wishes to get passive income, he or she may set up the Reddcoin Core Wallet and upload some RDD to it.  The wallet should be unlocked and connected to the network.  Staking requires no minimum amount of RDD.  The annual return is about 5%, and it is based on the initial investment.  PoSV (Proof of Stake Velocity) algorithm used by the project transforms all stakeholders into miners automatically.  Mining results depend both on ownership (stake) and activity (velocity).\n\nRDD token details\n\nThe Reddcoin initial public coin offering took place on January 20, 2014, while the token was released on February 2, 2014.  5,45 billion Reddcoins were sold, and the team got 168.83 Bitcoins for the projects\u2019 infrastructure development.\n\nRDD is traded on several exchanges, such as Bittrex, Cryptopia, YoBit, etc.  There are several ways to store coins.  A user may take advantage of the official project\u2019s wallet or the mobile Coinomi wallet.  The official wallet is more profitable because its users get the reward if they store coins in it.  But the process of its installation takes much time \u2013 up to two days.  The wallet is available for Windows, Linux, and Macintosh.\n\nThe Reddcoin team\n\nThe Reddcoin team operates internationally, the team members live in Europe, North America, and Australia.  According to LinkedIn, Reddcoin Solutions LLC is headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The project started in January 2014, but they officially introduced their team only in 2017.\n\nJay Laurence is the CEO/COO of Reddcoin.  He is a Bitcoin SHA256 and Scrypt Miner, and he also has volunteer experience.  John Nash is the CTO and Lead Developer.  He lives in Sydney, Australia, and before starting at Reddcoin he was a Project Manager and Solutions Architect at Ooyala, a content supply chain platform.\n\nThe company continues looking for volunteers to join the team.",

US-based Forecast Foundation that stands behind the project was founded by Jack Peterson and Joey Krug in November 2014, and advised by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and Intrade founder Ron Bernstein.  Having conducted a crowd sale in August 2015, the team has rolled out a fully functional platform by July 2018.  The main idea of the project is to use the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d to predict the outcomes of different events.  Users use the \u201cReputation\u201d token (REP) to bet on the outcomes of companies\u2019 performance, results of sports matches, weather forecasts, election results or prices of specific cryptocurrencies.  The main criteria for selecting an event is the possibility to obtain its result on the internet so that the so-called \u201coracles\u201d could pass on this information to the platform automatically without having to rely on any human input.  In order to place their bets, users create new events on the platform or participate in existing ones, buy shares to go long on the outcome and if eventually their side wins, they get a payout right to their Ethereum wallets.  They lose their tokens if the result is the opposite of the one they put their bet upon.  The payout is released by the Ethereum-based smart contracts.  Casinos and various bookmakers make up the target audience of this project.  The platform is fueled by an ERC-20 cryptocurrency named REP.  It is available for purchase on many exchange platforms including UpBit, Binance, HitBTC, and many others.  As it is based on the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, it can alternatively be obtained by mining on the same hardware that is used for Ethereum.  It can be stored on all Ethereum-compatible wallets such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet or Exodus.  For higher security, you may store REP coins on hardware wallets such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S.  Augur\u2019s ICO took place in 2015.  It started on August 17th and finished on October 1st.  The project managed to raise 5,2 million USD in ethers from 2,744 supporters.  Augur has a total supply of 11 million coins.  This number will never change and thus there is no inflation in the network.  Jack Peterson, the project\u2019s Founder and Lead Developer, has a technical research background.  Prior to launching Augur, he has worked in the software research and development area in various companies since 2006 and has a number of scientific publications on reputable platforms.    Jack\u2019s fellow and the co-founder of the project Joey Krug is a co-chief Investment Officer at Pantera Capital, a venture fund famous for investing in many promising blockchain projects.  He was an advisor of such blockchain projects as 0x, Origin, Numerai and some others.  He writes for Forbes on cryptocurrency-related topics.  In July 2018, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) opened a case against Augur for allegedly selling binary options without registering them which would be a violation of the US law.  Also, the project was criticized for letting people bet on the deaths of politicians, celebrities and other public people such as Donald Trump and Betty White.  In April 2018, there was a sensational scandal related to Augur as its former CEO Matthew Liston filed a lawsuit for 152 million USD against his four associates for alleged acts of fraud and trade theft that left him empty-handed without a stake in the ICO.  The case was settled and dismissed only in October.",

    "name": "Request-Network",
    "description": "Request, formerly called Request Network, (REQ) is a decentralized platform for transaction requests.  Anyone will be able to create, store, and access invoices and receipts using the Request protocol.  To participate in the Request network, users must use the REQ ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain.  REQ tokens can also be used to create advanced requests on the network as well as reward parties who help build the Request ecosystem.  According to the white paper, the ambitious goals of the project are to automate real-time global accounting, eliminate manual tax collection, simplify international payments, allow machines to communicate using the same decentralized ledger, and replace payment systems such as Paypal.  The project claims to be cheaper, faster, and more secure than centralized payment processors.\n\nChristopher Lassuyt and Etienne Tatur founded Request in 2017 after leaving Moneytis, a global money transfer platform that they co-founded in 2015.  While working on Moneytis, Lassuyt and Tatur found that invoices were the majority of cross country money transfers.  They believed that blockchain technology could simplify the process so they pivoted and created Request.  The company is registered in Singapore but is headquartered in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe Request protocol consists of 3 layers.  The core layer holds the basic smart contracts used to create and detect payment requests.  The extensions layer is an open layer that allows for various payment conditions (e.g., payment terms, advances, escrows, and taxes).  Finally, the application layer is the outermost layer which takes place outside the blockchain.  Here, the various systems from different financial organizations can connect to the Request network to obtain invoices and facilitate payments.\n\nThe protocol works as follows: a payee makes a payment request via the network.  The payer, upon accepting the request, pays the payee through the same network.  Both the request and payment are registered as a single ledger entry on the blockchain.  While all data is saved on a public blockchain, it is secured using elliptic-curve encryption so that it can only be read by the parties involved in the transaction.  Because payment information is never shared between the two parties, sensitive financial information is not at risk of being stolen.\n\nRequest uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to secure its blockchain.  The REQ token will act as an intermediary for cross-currency exchanges and will also be used to form governance for the decentralized platform.\n\nThe project completed their ICO on October 2017 and raised $33 million.  50 percent of the total supply were given to participating investors.  Early backers and contributors received 20 percent.  Request retained 15 percent of the total supply which will be used for further protocol development.  The last 15 percent was allocated to the team and advisors with a 2-year lock-up period.\n\nIn March 2018, the Request Protocol officially launched on the Ethereum mainnet.  In addition, the team also released a JavaScript library so that developers could expand coin support to include Bitcoin and all other ERC-20 tokens.\n\nIn June 2019, Request released the Request API which will allow developers to use the core Request protocol functionality without learning any new development skills.  This lowers the entry point for developers to connect their product or service to the Request network.\n\nIn August 2019, the project launched version 2 of the Request Protocol on the Ethereum mainnet.",

    "description": "Fueled by a native utility token RLC, the blockchain-based platform iExec represents the first decentralized marketplace for buying and selling computing resources.  As the project targets the market of high-performance applications that require significant resources for smooth execution, its key goal is to create the infrastructure that would be secure, transparent and resilient.  It also helps data providers monetize their datasets, apps and cloud computing resources.\n\nThe users of the platform who contribute their resources to the network are named \u201c\u2018iExec Workers\u201d and are rewarded with RLC tokens for their efforts.  Application and data providers can monetize their apps, algorithms, and datasets through the iExec platform.  The target industries that can win with the help of the new decentralized approach include Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, healthcare providers, big data companies, rendering services, and FinTech.\n\nThe trusted off-chain computing technologies that iExec relies upon has drawn the attention of many big companies.  As iExec\u2019s representative leads the \u201cTrusted Compute Working\u201d group within the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, the project has managed to set up partnerships with some of the world\u2019s leading IT giants.  The list of iExec\u2019s partners impresses as it includes IBM, Alibaba Cloud, Genesis Cloud, Intel, Ubisoft, EDF Electrical Utility Company and some other companies.  In addition to that, in October 2019, Hyperledger named iExec one of its key contributors developing Ethereum smart contracts along with Baidu, Chainlink, ConsenSys, Microsoft, Oracle, and others.\n\nDecentralizing the market of Cloud Computing\n\nUsed by such enterprises as Apple, Netflix, and Xerox, and backed by IT giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and IBM, Cloud Computing services are now widely used by businesses of all sizes all over the world.  The reason for such high popularity is simple.  It\u2019s much easier and cost-effective to give away your data for safekeeping to the third-party storage provider that has all the necessary resources rather than to set up the whole infrastructure yourself.\n\nIn 2019, the capitalization of this market counted more than 200 billion USD with all the forecasts showing that it only tends to grow exponentially.  As it is mostly represented by big centralized services, iExec doesn\u2019t aim to disrupt the industry by offering a decentralized solution to the same target audience.  Instead, it turns its attention towards the new sub-industry of decentralized applications and offers dApp developers a solution for cloud computing that would be similar to those offered by Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nEthereum platform being the pioneer of this area already has a working platform, but during the dApps\u2019 boom in 2017, it proved to be inefficient due to its low throughput indices.  The more participants join the network, the more sluggish it becomes which prevents it from being adopted at the mass scale.  Also, Ethereum\u2019s virtual machine (EVM) where all the smart contracts are executed is not capable of performing heavy computational tasks quickly and cost-efficiently.  Thus, iExec aims to create such a network of computing resources that would help to overcome the scalability issue.\n\nThe iExec technology\n\nThe iExec platform covers under its hood numerous providers that form a Virtual Cloud Infrastructure where the participants can either rent their storage space or make use of shared computing resources to run their applications.  There are no entry barriers as anyone can join the network regardless of the scale of tasks they need to resolve.  This is possible thanks to XtremWeb-HEP, an open-sourced Desktop Grid software provided by iExec.  Whether you own a small home laptop or a big data center, you are free to contribute to the network and earn cryptocurrency for that.\n\nThe core technology developed by iExec is the Proof of Contribution (PoC) protocol used for managing all the parties of the network.  This protocol is designed for certifying resources and linking them to external providers with all the records being stored on the blockchain in a fair and immutable manner.  This is the key technology that allows such flexibility and scalability.  \n\niExec is not the only project in the blockchain industry that focuses on decentralizing computing resources.  Among its closest competitors are Golem and SONM.  However, these two aim to build a decentralized supercomputer while iExec targets dApps\u2019 development.  Decentralized storage providers such as Storj, Siacoin, and Filecoin can also be considered part of the same league.\n\nThe RLC token\n\nRLC is the utility token that is used primarily on the iExec platform to access the services represented in its infrastructure.  This is the abbreviation that stands for \u201cRun on Lots of Computers\u201d.\n\nThe ICO started on April 18th, 2017.  The 10,000 BTC objective (~12 million USD at that time) was reached in less than 3 hours making it one of the most successful ICOs of all time.  The maximum token supply roughly equals 87 million RLC.  60 million of RLC were distributed via the crowdsale.\n\nThe RLC team\n\nHeadquartered in Lyon, France, the project was founded by Gilles Fedak (CEO) and Haiwu He (Head of Asian-Pacific Region).  The CTO of iExec is Oleg Lodygensky.\n\niExec team members have a strong scientific background.  There are six PhDs, four of which have been involved in cloud computing since the 2000s.  Gilles Fedak graduated from the University of Paris Sud in 2003 and received his PhD in Computer Science.  Prior to launching iExec, he had worked for 13+ years as a Research Scientist at INRIA (Inventeurs du Monde Numerique), the French national research institute for digital science and technology.  His colleague and partner Haiwu He also has a PhD in Computer Science and has been involved in different research projects all throughout his career.",

    "description": "Thorchain is a decentralized network that was conceptualized in 2018 by a team that participated in the Binance dexathon.  Soon afterward, it became a research project.  The network, which is called the first decentralized liquidity network proof-of-concept, enables cross-chain connection of users and their interaction.  \n\nThe history of the Thorchain project\n\nAfter the stage of research, the team members figured out that they are able to make the concept live but they had to take a pause and wait for the launch of the main tech stack of the project Cosmos SDK.  Following the emergence of the DeFi sector on Ethereum, the team was sure in its capability to bring DeFi to the cross-chain environment.  When KZen Networks Ltd., a company providing information technology services, released GG18 TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) in 2019 and Cosmos SDK acquired its maturity, TSS enabled a chain agnostic bridging solution that became an impetus for the further development of the project.  \n\nThe launch of the testnet occurred at the end of 2018.  The first bridge was launched in 2019, while the network started functioning fully at the beginning of 2020.  \n\nThorchain platform\n\nThe assets supported by the network can be easily swapped via a peer-to-peer connection.  It\u2019s important to connect the wallet for it.  The process of swapping is easy.  There is clear guidance inside the wallet telling users what to do.  The token swaps are conducted without delay at a small fee.  \n\nThere is a possibility to earn Thorchain native utility token of the network, which is RUNE, by staking it.  Stakers can also get block rewards.  There is also a possibility to run nodes for the members of the community who want to earn rewards.  Thorchain nodes are used to maintain and protect the network by the verification of the authenticity of transactions.  Those who run the nodes monitor transactions on external chains, operate the protocol, and approve of the outgoing transactions.  Node operators get two-thirds of the network fees.  The refreshment of the nodes occurs every three days for the promotion of the network.  It helps them to remain dynamic and inclusive.  It\u2019s also possible for the nodes to leave when users wish.  It\u2019s only needed to submit the request for that, which is processed within several hours.  \n\nIt\u2019s necessary to have high-performance hardware and software at your disposal if you want to run a validator node.  Additionally, such a person should stake at least 1 million RUNE.  Though it may seem that the requirement is too strict, the compensation for their work is worth it.  The bond rewards as they are called make 67% of the system\u2019s revenue.  At this, the share of liquidity providers is 33%.  The rules also presuppose the penalties of node operators for wrong behavior, for instance, when they try to defraud the network.  \n\nThorchain products\n\nThe products of THORChain include BET Swap, the application enabling BNB BEP2 token holders to swap assets, deposit assets for liquidity, or to earn commissions from traders.  This is also a way to derive a higher benefit from trade.  \n\nFlash Network is another product developed by the team.  A layer-2 network helps to support instant asset swaps, exchanges between the numerous tokens and liquidity pools.  It\u2019s worth mentioning that it\u2019s compatible with such efficient layer2 technologies as Lightning Network, Bolt, and Raiden.\n \nRUNEVault is a staking interface enabling staking and earning rewards for it.  The Bitfr\u00f6st Protocol is a cross-chain protocol that delivers connectivity between blockchains thus solving one of the most topical problems of the blockchain, i.e.  its interoperability.  Using this protocol, the members of the community are able to trade easily across any blockchain.   \n\nRUNE token \n\nThe native token of the platform RUNE was launched in June 2019 on the Binance blockchain.  The platform issued 500 million tokens.  The token was listed on Binance and was distributed to the community members free of charge for promotion services.  \n\nRUNE is a utility token that plays an essential role in the development of the ThorChain ecosystem.  RUNE is used for staking as was mentioned above.  The system of the nodes management requires the staking mechanism.  The native token is needed to pay for transactions within the ecosystem and other fees.  Also, the liquidity added to the network should be supported by RUNE in Continuous Liquidity Pools.  It\u2019s necessary to have native cryptocurrency to join Liquidity Hubs.  It means that RUNE works as a settlement currency for the network as well.  The swaps are non-custodial and no third party is involved in them.  It\u2019s possible to swap funds directly from the wallets supported by the network.  \n\nThe number of exchanges offers this cryptocurrency paired with the most popular digital assets such as Bitcoin, Tether, Ethereum, and others.  The asset can be purchased on such exchanges as FTX, BitMax, Binance, and Bilaxy.  Being a BEP-2 compliant token, it is supported by the Binance wallet, hence the storage in this wallet is available.  Additionally, users can resort to such solutions as Atomic Wallet, Ledger, Guarda, Trust Wallet, etc.  \n\nThorChain team\n\nThe company behind the project is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland.  The team doesn\u2019t disclose the personalities of its members for the protection of the project, as they assert, saying that founders try to undermine the process of decentralization.",

    "description": "Siacoin (SC) is a utility token that powers the Sia Storage Platform, an open-source, decentralized cloud storage system.  The Sia platform allows users to earn Siacoin by renting out spare hard drive capacity or store files using other people\u2019s spare hard drive space paying them in Siacoin.  The Sia blockchain is secured using a proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithm.  \n\nWhen a user uploads data to the Sia platform, it\u2019s encrypted, divided into several smaller components, and stored on nodes all over the world.  The only way to access the data is to decrypt it with the user\u2019s private keys.\n\nThe Sia network utilizes storage smart contracts where both the \u201chost\u201d (storage provider) and \u201crenter\u201d (user uploading data) lock up some Siacoin in a smart contract escrow along with a transaction fee that the renter pays.  After a specified time chosen by the renter, the system automatically checks to see if the data is still available from the host.  If the host is offline or loses the encrypted data, they forfeit their staked Siacoins in the escrow account.  If the host provides the encrypted data, their collateral is returned and they are paid via the smart contract.  \n\nThe Sia platform also has a secondary, revenue-sharing token called SiaFunds (SF).  This digital asset gives the holder a portion of the transaction fees each time a file is uploaded to the Sia network.  The purpose of SiaFunds is to incentivize token holders to improve the storage platform by bringing on more users.  With more people using the Sia network, SiaFund token holders receive more Siacoin. \n\nThere are only 10,000 SiaFunds and all have been pre-mined.  At the time of this writing, Nebulous Inc., Siacoin\u2019s parent company, owned over 8,000 SaiFunds and the remaining were sold in a crowdfund to help finance early development.\n\nThe idea for Siacoin was conceived in September 2013 by David Vorick and Luke Champine at HackMIT, a student-run hackathon held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  At that time, both Vorick and Champine were undergraduate computer science students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.\n\nIn May 2014, they cofounded the Boston-based company, Nebulous Inc., the core development team behind the Siacoin project.  In that same month, Nebulous raised $240,000 from a SiaFund sale.  In September 2014, it received a seed round of $750,000 from investors including Procyon Venture and angel investor, Xiaolai Li.  \n\nLess than one year, the first public beta of the Siacoin network was released in March 2015.\n\nIn July 2019, Nebulous closed a $3.5 million pre\u2013Series A round led by Bain Capital Ventures, along with participants like Bessemer Venture Partners and Dragonfly Capital Partners.",

    "description": "Seele is a utility token that can be used on a blockchain-based platform with the same name.  The project calls itself the fourth generation blockchain as it claims to be much faster than all its predecessors and plans to take the leading role with the help of its robust functionality.  Making use of the latest innovations, Seele aims to create a special ecosystem for developers.  One of the key features that help Seele stand out of all other blockchain-based solutions is the Neural Consensus Algorithm that is designed to resolve the problem of scalability and help the new platform become much more efficient than its alternatives.  This technology is also pretty secure as it makes the cost of any hacker\u2019s attack significantly exceed the expected profits.  In addition to solving the scalability issue, Seele implements Value Transport Protocol (VTP) and Value-Chain HTTP (VHTTP) in order to facilitate the exchange of values among different blockchains and thus overcomes the problem of interoperability.    Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum that rely solely on the Proof-of-Work mining algorithm that results in pretty low throughput indices of these networks, Seele has modified this algorithm into the Matrix-Proof-of-Work (MPoW).  This new algorithm is designed to prevent mining power from being concentrated in the hands of a few miners and makes Seele ASIC-resistant.  Also, Seele implements the Sharding technology to reach the high throughput indices (up to 2,000 transactions per second).  The project was first announced on Bitcointalk on January 25th, 2018.  The public ICO took place on April 3rd and raised its hard cap of 12 million USD in less than a day with the total token supply of 1 billion SEELE.  It\u2019s worth noting that only 25% of tokens were distributed in a public sale.  The rest was allocated for the community airdrop, development team, mining reward, and other areas.  At the time of writing, the tokens are still based on the Ethereum network, while the Seele Foundation plans to conduct the token swap and help token holders shift their coins to their own blockchain.  SEELE is available for trading mainly on Huobi Global and CoinEx.  The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with offices in Shenzhen, London, and Singapore.  Maolin Zheng, CEO and Founding Member, has a diverse scientific background having worked as a Chief Scientist in financial companies since 2009.  Other members of the team are all about science as well with Ph.D. in such areas as Mathematics, Physics, and Computer science.",

    "name": "SHIBA-INU",
    "description": "SHIBA INU is an ERC-20 token named after the breed of Shiba Inu dog, which is the mascot of the community.  It is one of the joke coins available on the cryptocurrency market at present.  The tokens are referred to as Meme Coins on the official website of the platform.\n\nThe Shiba Inu project was launched in August 2020.  The founder of the project under the nickname Ryoshi has selected the Ethereum blockchain because it\u2019s well-reputed and more decentralized in comparison with other networks hence it\u2019s safer.  \n\nThe creators of Shiba Inu were inspired by the example of WallStreetBets that increased the price of the GameStop shares and other companies.  The community is called Shib Army by the members of the community.  The \u201carmy\u201d is increasingly growing and exceeds 120,000 token holders at the time of writing.  \n\nThe aims targeted by the Shiba Inu project\n\nThe website of the project says that the token is a Dogecoin killer, the main task of which is to overcome its total cap without reducing the token price.  The supporters of the project assure that the token features the capability to outpace the value of Dogecoin without crossing the mark of 0.01 USD per token.  \n\nThe whitepaper of Shiba Inu that is jokingly called Woofpaper says that Shiba is an experiment on the construction of a decentralized community.  The team plans to create the best decentralized ecosystem DECO on the planet.  The goal is to create a community-driven platform without initial funding and direct leadership.  \n\nShiba Inu platform\n\nThe first step on the way to the building of the decentralized ecosystem is the creation of a decentralized platform Shiba Swap.  The facility enables its users to be engaged in farming activity and liquidity mining through the tokens of the ecosystem Shib.  The Shib team also plans to release its NFT tokens.\n\nShibaSwap was created with the goal to establish a safe trading decentralized ground.  The scaling and growth of the ecosystem are the goals of the ShibaSwap platform.  Apart from SHIB, ShibaSwap presents other flagship tokens of the project described below.\n\nThere is also one more token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem known as LEASH that was created as a rebase token tied to the Dogecoin price.  Additionally, the ecosystem also includes a governance token known as Bone that enables its holders to participate in the life of the community and vote for proposals.  The weight of a vote depends on the number of tokens in the possession of its holders.\n\nThe process of staking is called burying.  The members of the community bury SHIB, LEASH, and BONE to get xSHIB, xLEASH, and tBONE.  \n\nThe liquidity pairs on ShibaSwap include Shib-Eth SSLP, Leash-Eth SSLP, and Bone-Eth SSLP.  The distribution of rewards occurs proportionally between holders depending upon the number of their contributions.  The staked tokens get a fixed percentage of BONE, and the distribution of BPB (Bone per block) is performed on the basis of the allocation points to individual Puppy Pools.  Some of the Puppy Pools can bring double or triple returns.\n\nTo add power to xSHIB (a minted version of SHIB), staking is performed with the distribution of reward that is 3% of all BPB.  Additionally, it is provided with 0.3% of all ETH swap transaction fees that take place on ShibaSwap.  The procedure is called a double return puppy pool.  \n\nShiba Inu token\n\nThe official website of the token says that half of the total supply is locked on Uniswap, while the other half was sent to Vitalik Buterin who burnt 90% of his holdings in May 2021.  10% of the remaining amount in Shiba Inu was donated by Vitalik Buterin to the Covid Crypto Relief Fund.  The amount of donation exceeded a billion USD.  This decision was taken by Buterin as he didn\u2019t want to be a locus of power in the project after the founder of the Shiba Inu platform sent 50% of the total supply to him.  \n\nThe token holders can either bury their SHIB tokens and get xSHIB from the xSHIB pool or dig their holdings to get Shib-Eth SSLP share of the pool.  The coin can be purchased on such trading platforms as Binance, OKEX, and Huobi.  Actually, the price of the cryptocurrency surged after it was enlisted in these facilities.  \n \nAccording to the Woofpaper, 33% of returns are available for members of the community, while 66% of funds remain locked for 6 months.\n\nShiba Inu team\n\nThe founder of the Shiba Inu community known under the nickname \u201cRyoshi\u201d is anonymous.  He hasn\u2019t spent a penny on the project and doesn\u2019t own any admin or team tokens emphasizing that he is just one of the community members with the same rights.  There is no information about the team as well.  It is only known that the volunteer team that supports the project is small.",

    "name": "Status-Network-Token",
    "description": "Status is an open-source peer-to-peer decentralized application based on Ethereum.  It represents a mobile Ethereum OS that serves as a mobile browser with a range of functions.  One of them is WeChat-like dApp that enables sending of p2p encrypted messages and allows sending and receiving Ether and ERC-20 tokens.  The project was launched in 2017 in Zug, Switzerland, by Carl Bennetts and Jarrad Hope.\n\nStatus also acts as a store for Ethereum dApps, therefore, it is often compared with Google Store or AppStore that perform the same function in the world of centralized applications.  Being a messaging application for users of Ethereum platform, it also gives the possibility to select the node provider.  It turns the smartphone into a light node that connects to other dApps.  \n\nThe goals of the project\n\nAll legacy social networks come with the same flaw.  Their members don\u2019t have any influence and they can\u2019t affect the development of the platform.  The goal of Status is to create a system without this drawback.  The founders believe in the strength of blockchain-fueled economic systems, which seem to be more reliable than centralized ones because they are based on economic interests.  For this reason, Status members experience a more democratic approach, during which people can express their opinion on how the system evolves.  It refers to all areas including software development.  The stakeholders of SNT tokens are provided with voting rights and can participate in Status governance thus affecting the development of the platform.\n\nIn contrast to other platforms, Status Network Token (SNT) gives the power that users of other systems are deprived of.  SNT holders can decide how the system should develop as its members vote for different proposals using SNT.  The number of tokens held is converted into the amount of voting power.  As for the voting procedure itself, it\u2019s absolutely free.  \n\nThe Status platform and technology\n\nStatus is a web 3.0 browser that was designed to interact with more than 2,000 dApps on the Ethereum network.  It also delivers a window into the decentralized web.  The clients within the ecosystem of different applications use Status as a gateway to free trading and p2p payments and communication which is possible for any person with Internet access on a mobile gadget.  \n\nStatus uses a new communication subprotocol named Whisper.  It delegates nodes to store messages sent to the clients when they are offline.   Since service providers charge for the service in SNT, it also helps to develop the market of push notifications.\n\nThe goal of the notification system is to become compatible with as many devices as possible and at the same time feature resistance to censorship.  Therefore, the Status notification system is an excellent option for countries blocking certain notification providers.  If a user, let\u2019s say, from China can\u2019t use Google Cloud Messaging, the system allows selecting another notification provider to bypass these restrictions.  \n\nSNT token\n\nSNT is needed to select and receive push notifications.  Though Status is free by default and users are identified by SECP256k1 public key, SNT is required to register your username in the system.  In some cases, it\u2019s done to help your friends identify you easily, or to recover your account when your mobile device is lost.  For instance, it can be necessary for participation in dApps\u2019 discussion board where developers permit only registered users.  With the help of SNT, users can improve the quality of content or stay protected from the activity of sockpuppet accounts.  \n\nSNT can also be used to create token-based group chats.  Also, members use SNT after the introduction of the anti-spam filter called \u201cTribute to talk\u201d that protects from spam messages.  The stakeholders set a minimum amount of SNT that the other member must meet to open a conversation.  The deposit is returned when a reply is received.  This is not a full list of SNT utilities within the ecosystem.  It\u2019s also needed to become a Seller in Teller Network, a Seller or Buyer in the Acquisition Engine, for participation in the Sticker Market, for arbitration, etc.  \n\nThe platform offers its own Status Hardware Wallet named Keycard for the storage of cryptocurrencies.   However, users can store SNT on any other wallet supporting ERC-20 tokens, for instance, Coinomi, MetaMask, and Myetherwallet.  Those who want to increase the security of their assets can store digital assets on hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger Nano S.  \n\nSNT is not a mineable coin, but it can be obtained via an open bounty program.  Consumers can buy SNT at Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Poloniex and many other exchanges, usually paired with BTC, ETH.  \n\nStatus ICO details\n\nStatus ICO was conducted on June 21, 2017.  It was planned that the sale will continue until the 4th if July, but it was much anticipated, therefore, the cap was reached fast and even broke down the ETH network as it caused congestion and backlog.  As a result, ICO raised more than 99 million US dollars (299,897.84 ETH) within just a few hours.  \nFunds are allocated in the following way.  50% of the funds raised during the contribution period is allocated to the core development.  15% was given to the project security and 15% went to finance everyday activities.  10% of funds were given to cover marketing costs and 10% is allocated to deal with legal and compliance expenses.  \n\nTeam\n\nThe company is based in Switzerland\u2019s Crypto Valley and its team includes over 70 full-time employees.  \n\nThe founders of the project Carl Bennets and Jarrad Hope had been working in the area of software distribution before they launched Status.  Using their rich experience with personal data and database growth, they managed to make the platform rather popular.  The results of ICO demonstrate that the service is promising and highly demanded.  The other key figure of the project is Nabil Naghdy, COO, who worked as a product manager at Google before joining Status.  In particular, he managed such products as Google Maps and Google Flights.\n\nStatus partners with Finney, a secure blockchain-powered smartphone.  The partnership was announced in December 2017.  Also, the company united its efforts with FOAM, Ethereum-based protocol that provides decentralized location services and with OmiseGO that delivers cross-chain transactions for users.   It also cooperates with a team working over the Nim programming language, which was selected as language for Status.  It\u2019s a lightweight language and was chosen for its efficiency.",

    "name": "Solana",
    "description": "SOL is a native token of a high-throughput DLT-based cryptocurrency platform Solana.  The company behind the platform is Solana Labs, Inc., based in San Francisco.  It develops a scalable, decentralized Layer 1 blockchain network devoid of security risks that are often entailed by the sharding technology.\n\nThe platform is based on the Proof of History algorithm that delivers mathematically guaranteed proofs of time-lapse between two transactions.  The algorithm of Solana enables a reliable check and verification of the timestamp on each block.  Such an approach decreases the time needed to prevent the production of the same block by other participants.  The goal of Solana is to produce up to 710 transactions per second on a 1GB network without partitioning of data.\n\nSolana technology\n\nCoordination between the event and synchronization of time between transactions is the basic problem that Solana aims to resolve.  Coordination of events requires time and huge resources.\nSharding is one of the techniques used by developers to achieve the goal but this solution has a range of vulnerabilities, including the problem with the partitioning of the transactions.  When it\u2019s not handled well, it entails fraudulent transactions and double-spending.\n\nA time-based approach applied to a consensus within the Solana blockchain doesn\u2019t require all nodes of the network to confirm a transaction.  The only thing that is needed is to confirm that an event A took place before an event B.  To make it possible, Solana designed a new blockchain architecture with a new concept integrated into it that features better scalability and lower costs.\nCoordination of time is a complicated issue and Solana brings its own unusual solution that is called Proof of History.  The platform employs blockchain for trusted time coordination thus reducing expenditures on it.  The procedure employed by Solana is performed faster and also helps to save time.  The design of the system implies that the Proof of History sequence works together with a cryptographic hash function.\n\nThe developers usually face a lot of challenges with Layer 2 and sharding solutions.  Solana has developed incredibly simple alternatives without sacrificing performance.  The main challenge that holds back the industry in the opinion of Solana\u2019s CEO is the structure of all blockchains that present single-threaded processors.  This is the reason why they can make only one update at a time.  Solana, instead, offers a multithreaded solution that is able to manage 50,000 TPS on a global network including 200 nodes.  This is an incredible achievement taking into account that Tron and Ripple can process 2,000 TPS and 1,500 TPS correspondingly, while VISA can handle 65,000 TPS.\n\nSOL token\n\nSolana raised a seed round in 2018 and then built a private testnet.  Series A funding was needed to improve engineering and project management before launching a mainnet.\n\nSeries A investment round secured 21.5 million USD in funding with a leading investor Multicoin Capital.  The list of other companies that contributed their investments include such companies as Distributed Global, Blocktower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital, and Rockaway Ventures.  The investors received SOL tokens in exchange for their investment, not equity in Solana.\n\nThe interest of investors is partly explained by the fact that the company provided a staking guarantee to shelter early investors making SOL coin redeemable 90% of the auction clearing price.  The guarantee works even when users buy coins on the exchanges that listed the coin.  The launch auction conducted on Coinlist in March 2020 provided 1.76 million USD in funding to the platform.  In this way, the volume of capital raised by the company has reached 25.6 million USD.  The platform sold 8 million SOL tokens at a rate of 0.22 USD per token via a Dutch auction.  The sale ended on March 25th, 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s necessary to create a wallet if you want to get SOL tokens on the Solana blockchain.  Solana supports different kinds of wallets in the Solana native app and wallets from third parties.  The Solana team recommends using Trust Wallet, Ledger Live, Ledger Nano S for common users.  The advanced users can employ Command Line Wallets supporting different types of wallets to be used directly in the interface with command-line tools that should be first installed.  Solana Tool Suite is offered on the site of the platform.\n\nSolana team and partnerships\n\nMany members of the Solana founding team are from telecom hardware giant Qualcomm.\nAnatoly Yakovenko, the founder and CEO of the project, has vast experience of work, previously contributing efforts to the development of such projects as Qualcomm, Mesosphere, Brew, and Dropbox.  Anatoly is a holder of 2 patents for highly efficient operating systems protocols.\n\nGreg Fitzgerald, CTO and co-founder of Solana, used to work as a senior software engineer at Qualcomm.  Being proficient at JavaScript, Python, C++, and Haskell he was tech lead for web and messaging infrastructure team.\n\nEric Williams, co-founder and Chief Scientist, is at the head of the data science division and token economics in Solana.  Eric is a Berkeley graduate, where he studied particle physics.

    "description": "Synthetix develops a blockchain-based payment network fueled by a stable coin aiming to combine all the benefits of a decentralized approach with the stability of traditional financial assets.  In order to reach stability, the project implements a dual token solution that consists of a stabilized Ethereum-based utility token SNX and a reserve token Nomin to back it.  Nomin is pegged to the value of 1 USD and is used to make transactions on the platform.  \n\nPreviously known as Havven, the project was rebranded in November 2018, and now bears the name of Synthetix.  It is fueled by a native ERC-20 cryptocurrency SNX.\n\nOn the Synthetix platform, SNX tokens serve to stabilize and collateralize the system, while their holders get the transactions fees.  The size of payouts depends on their contribution to the stability of the Nomin token.  SNX token holders place their assets in an escrow account in order to issue Nomins, as the total value of SNX in escrow is always bigger than the value of Nomins in circulation.  The collateral ratio of nomins to SNX equals to 1:5.  This helps to ensure that nomins can always be redeemed for their face value even if the price of SNX dramatically drops.\n\nThe Havven (Synthetix) ICO was launched on February 28th, 2018, and ended in a week on March 7th having helped the project\u2019s creators raise the hardcap of 30 million USD.  In order to participate in ICO, investors had to pass a thorough KYC (Know-Your-Customer) procedure and get whitelisted.  60% of tokens were distributed via ICO while 20% went to the Havven team and the rest was allocated for bounties, different marketing incentives, and the foundation.  At the time of writing, the rebranded token SNX is available for trading on KuCoin and Cyber Network.\n\nIn August 2018, Synthetix announced its plans to switch to EOS in order to overcome the scalability issue inherent to all Ethereum-based projects.  However, having spent several months on that, the team decided that the migration would turn out to be very costly for them, so they gave up this idea.  At the time of writing, Synthetix still remains on Ethereum and SNX tokens can be stored on all ETH-compatible wallets, such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, Trezor and Ledger Nano S.\n\nThe project was founded in Sydney, Australia, in 2017 when Tether (USDT) was the only viable stable coin in the market.  The team is headed by Kain Warwick who prior to Synthetix managed to build Blueshyft, the largest cryptocurrency payment platform in Australia covering tens of millions transactions (primarily in Bitcoin).  The platform allows to cash out purchases of digital goods and services and since its launch in 2014, it has grown to cover 1200 locations across the whole continent.\n\nBefore joining Synthetix, Justin Moses, the project\u2019s CTO has worked for 8 years as a Head of Engineering at various companies, including MongoDB, a leading cross-platform database system.\n\nSynthetix\u2019s board of advisors includes Doc.Ai CEO Walter De Brouwer, Blockasset Managing Partner Renqi Shen, ZK Labs founder Matthew Di Ferrante and many other experienced people with successful projects behind their shoulders.",

    "description": "Steem is a cryptocurrency token that fuels a blockchain-based decentralized social platform Steemit that helps people monetize the content they create.  In addition, there also exist such units as Steem Dollars (SD, a stablecoin) and Steem Power (SP, a utility token) that serve as a means of payment on the platform Steemit for creating and curating new content.   In order to earn cryptocurrency, users of the Steem-based social network create engaging content.  Their readers upvote the articles that they like.  The more a single piece of content is upvoted, the higher is the author\u2019s reward.  After a certain period of time, authors convert Steem into Steem dollars and simply withdraw them to their linked fiat accounts.    The decentralized nature of the Steem platform helps authors to protect their copyright and make real money by simply posting their articles on the web.  Such a model has become really popular and for several years in a row Steem continues holding top ranks at Blockctivity. info as one of the most active blockchains.   Similar to Bitcoin, Steem is available for trading with the fluctuating value on different exchanges.  The core difference lies in the consensus algorithm.  Steem is based on the Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) which was developed as an alternative means of securing the blockchain network and verifying transactions on it.   DPoS is a technological way of implementing democratic principles based on the voting and election process.  Is serves to protect the network from getting centralized and being used for malicious purposes.  Active users vote for their delegates as they place the tokens they possess on the name of their candidate without losing the ownership rights.  Those candidates who get more votes gain the right to produce new blocks and govern the network activities by verifying transactions.   Such a system allows the Steem blockchain to verify transactions in a much faster way than the PoW (Proof-of-Work) solutions such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Also, it makes it scalable and energy-efficient.   Unlike Bitcoin, Steem is an inflationary asset with the inflation rate decreasing in time.  It was initially launched with a relatively high inflationary supply model, but due to community demand, it was set to be only 9.5% decreasing by 0.01% every 250,000 blocks or approximately by 0.5% per year.  The inflation is expected to decrease at the same pace until it reaches 0.95% which is expected to happen by the year 2036.   75% of the newly generated tokens go to the reward pool which is then split among authors and curators.  15% of Steem tokens are granted to holders of Steem Power and the remaining 10% are paid to the witnesses who power the blockchain.   The Steem blockchain was invented, developed and released by Ned Scott, Steemit\u2019s Executive Chairman, together with Dan Larrimer who has a few other successful blockchain projects behind his shoulders (Bitshares, EOS).  The two co-founders met in January 2016 and released the Steem blockchain 2 months later.   In September 2018, Steemit experienced a 9-hour downtime. The cause of the outage has never been identified and no funds have been lost.  2 months later, Steemit reportedly laid off 70% of its staff due to the bear market and the overall sad condition of the industry.",

    "description": "Stratis represents a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that simplifies the development process by offering C# and .NET frameworks.  Both of these programming languages have been utilized by developers for a while already and are familiar to the market while Solitidy and other languages for smart contracts are pretty new and complex which results in numerous bugs in the code.\n\nWith the help of Stratis, businesses can build their own private blockchains without having to operate the whole infrastructure.  The project targets businesses of all sizes with the key focus on those who run their services in a Windows/Microsoft environment.  The platform is fueled by a native cryptocurrency STRAT and run by a London-based consulting agency that helps its clients create custom chains in accordance with their needs.\n\nStratis BaaS model\n\nOn the platform, Stratis offers its users the following set of the out-of-the-box components:\n\nPrivate chains\nSmart contracts\nOne-click deployment system\nICO platform\nStratis Identity solution\n\nBusinesses don\u2019t have to develop all these items from scratch and maintain the costly infrastructure as Stratis takes all these headaches on itself.  The platform takes the responsibility of managing the blockchain networks and distributed ledgers via cloud computing and helps its customers to refocus their efforts to improve their own businesses.\n\nInitially targeting the financial sector, Stratis has expanded its coverage and now offers its services to many other types of businesses.  Also, in late 2018, Stratis was listed on the Microsoft Azure\u2019s marketplace in the BaaS segment.\n\nIn December 2019, Stratis released the Security Token Offering platform compliant with US law and making it possible to raise funds on the blockchain in a fully legalized way.\n\nBusiness use cases for Stratis private chains\n\nStratis offers businesses not only blockchain as a service but also strives to become a turnkey solution provider for companies that want to create customized blockchains for their own use.  The platform allows launching private sidechains that are fully connected to the main Stratis blockchain and help companies with the following tasks.\n\nFirst, sidechains make it possible to deploy custom applications without having to maintain the whole network.  This helps businesses to significantly cut costs and at the same time gives access to the secure and stable solution as all the sidechains are connected to the main well-tested blockchain.\n\nNext, sidechains are quite easy to use which reduces the time that companies need to develop and test their blockchain-based apps.  Also, there is an option for launching your own cryptocurrency which can be used for purchasing gas to run smart contracts.  Companies can customize different operational aspects of their sidechains, such as block sizes, transaction management and ways of how metadata is stored.\n\nFinally, although sidechains operate independently, they are still compatible with each other which simplifies the transfer of value within the system.\n\nReal-life Stratis use cases\n\nSome of the benefits that Stratis provides the real-world businesses are the following:\n\nMedical research.  With Stratis, medical research companies can easily solve their publication disputes as all the data will be stored in an immutable database.  Reviewers, researchers, and publishers will be able to work with the research data without having to worry about its legitimacy.\nInternet of Things.  Such industries as transportation, supply chain, and inventory can make use of the blockchain synchronized with the IoT devices and updating the real-world information in the real-time.\nSupply chain.  Stratis can help to resolve the problem of tracking the products\u2019 sources and counterfeit by storing the supply chain information in an immutable way on the blockchain.\nFintech.  In the Fintech space, Stratis can be implemented in various ways helping to resolve the problems of trustless transactions, Identity Theft, Identity Management, KYC compliances, and many others.\n\nSTRAT token\n\nThe native cryptocurrency used on the Stratis platform bears the STRAT ticker.  The project released the tokens during the initial coin offering that took place in July 2016.  \n\nWith the help of this initiative, the project managed to raise 675 thousand USD worth of bitcoins that were used for the development of the product.  98 million STRAT tokens were distributed to investors.  STRAT is available for trading on many reputable exchange platforms including Bittrex, Binance, and Bithumb.  It can be stored on a native Breeze and Stratis Core wallets that are available for download on the official website or on third-party wallets such as Jaxx and Electrum.  For those who want to get enhanced protection of their funds, a hardware wallet Ledger Nano S can also be an option.\n\nNew tokens are created with the help of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism which is energy-efficient compared to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm.  Also, STRAT holders can stake their tokens and get periodically rewarded by the system.\n\n\nThe Stratis team\n\nSince Stratis was launched while the level of competition in the blockchain industry was relatively low and projects didn\u2019t have to prove their expertise with relevant profiles on Linkedin and other social media platforms, there is no information about the project founders except for that listed on their website.\n\nChris Trew is mentioned on the project\u2019s website as the CEO and Founder.  He has extensive experience in the financial sector as prior to founding Stratis he has worked for some of the top financial institutions for more than 10 years.  He is also a consultant, architect and a backend developer specializing in ASP.NET and C# technologies.\n\nKrushang Patel is listed as the Head of Communications and the second person in the project.  He has 15+ years of experience in retail and international import/export having worked with more than 10 different countries.",

    "description": "Theta is an open-source protocol that underlies a decentralized video-streaming network with the same name.  It aims to resolve various problems that are inherent to the highly centralized streaming industry, such as technical issues resulting in low quality of stream delivery and the lack of adequate reach across the world.  \n\nTheta is designed for the creation of decentralized apps for esports, entertainment, and peer-to-peer streaming with SLIVER.tv\u2019s dApp being the first one to test it out.  The platform is powered by the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency THETA and a utility token TFUEL that functions similar to GAS on the NEO blockchain.\n\nThe issues that Theta aims to resolve\nWith live video streaming platforms being on the rise along with the blockchain industry, Theta team has decided to merge these two areas into one.  Theta blockchain provides a whole environment for decentralized video streaming helping its users monetize their bandwidth and get paid with cryptocurrency.\n\nThe team standing behind Theta targets to resolve a number of problems with the content delivery networks of today.  The networks don\u2019t have enough reach across different countries while the streaming process itself is accompanied by numerous technical issues such as pauses, skips, stuttering and poor video quality.  To overcome these issues, Theta creates a decentralized peer-to-peer platform where users can get rewards for sharing their resources and for maintaining the high level of the platform\u2019s performance.\n\nAnother set of issues that Theta aims to overcome is related to the excessive centralization of the current streaming industry.  Content creators have to give away the lion\u2019s share of their profits to centralized advertisers and platforms as they have no other alternative but to post their content on these platforms.  Theta eliminates the need for intermediaries and allows viewers to reward their favorite streamers directly.  In addition, the new model allows reducing overall costs for streams\u2019 delivery and thus helps viewers spend less money for more content.\n\nTheta network \nThe network developed by Theta makes use of its peer-to-peer architecture to complement and eventually replace the existing content delivery networks.  It consists of multiple nodes that represent pieces of hardware designed for viewing video content and maintained by their owners all across the globe\n\nAll these nodes can turn into \u201ccaching nodes\u201d in the Theta network and supply the users of the platform with the resources needed for video streaming.  Since the network is decentralized and its participants are located all around the world, the content delivery will no longer depend on huge data centers whose remote location may have a negative effect on the quality of the video streams.\n\nNodes are rewarded with Theta tokens for their efforts that serve as an incentive to share the bandwidth with the network.  Theta hopes to reduce the cost associated with the content delivery by as much as 80% since the large data centers\u2019 maintenance will no longer be needed.\n\nIn order to overcome the scalability issues, Theta developers implement such technologies as:\nMulti-Level Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) which enables more efficient scaling\nAggregated Signature Gossip Scheme which continuously links close fragments to broadcast to other nodes\nResource-Oriented Micropayment Pool for off-chain processing and micropayments\n\nTheta tokens\nInitially launched on the Ethereum network, Theta has released its mainnet on March 16th, 2019, swapping its tokens at a 1:1 ratio.  The new network is based on the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm with tokens being staked to become validator nodes.\n\nThe main use cases of these tokens in the Theta network are as follows:\n\nContent creators are rewarded with Theta tokens for their content.\nContent viewers can earn tokens for engaging in the advertorial content.\nAdvertisers can pay with these tokens for their campaigns.\nCaching nodes earn tokens for relaying and caching video streams.\nTokens can also serve as a means of payment for the premium content.\nAn additional utility token TFUEL is used to pay for transactions similar to how Gas is used on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Theta tokens have a total supply of 1 billion THETA.  The private token sale started on January 8th and ended on February 8th, 2018.  Approximately 300 million tokens were distributed helping the team raise 20 million worth of ethers.  The rest of tokens were distributed in the following way:\n\n22.5% - Theta reserve\n15% - Network seed/strategic partners\n7.5% - advisors\n25% - Miner Reserve\n\nTheta Team and Partners\nThe company itself is headquartered in California.  Theta\u2019s CEO and co-founder Mitch Liu is also the founding member of the video game streaming site SLIVER.tv launched in 2015.  Prior to founding Theta, Mitch had worked for almost 5 years as a President of Gameview Studios.\n\nJieyi Long is the project\u2019s other co-founder and CTO.  He was also deeply involved in the creation of SLIVER.tv.  He stands behind another successful project, 3D mobile gaming engine MadSkill Gaming Studios.\n\nOther team members include Riz Virk (Head of Corp Development) and Ryan Nichols (Chief Product Officer) - both with the broad experience in many other video gaming projects.\n\nOne of the key strategic partners that Theta has gained so far is a popular video streaming service Twitch, which now allows its users to earn Theta tokens for sharing their bandwidth.  Another strategic partner of the project is Samsung VR.",

This will allow content creators to connect directly with consumers, cutting out middlemen and removing the barriers to independent producers seeking distribution channels. It claims users will benefit from the data they create, unlike traditional social platforms that harvest your data and monetize it. \n\n Founded by a Singapore-based non-profit, the Tron Foundation not only aims to capitalize on the global entertainment industry, but, according to its whitepaper, sees its protocol as an enabler for live social broadcasting, gambling applications, gaming, and social or dating interactions. \n\n Tronix can be used by content consumers to pay for the content they want to access on the Tron network. These coins then go to the content producers\u2019 accounts, where they can be exchanged to other cryptocurrencies, or used to pay for blockchain services. At launch, TRX was an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet; in June 2018, when the Tron mainnet launched, the ERC-20 tokens were migrated to the native TRX coin (TRON20) at a 1:1 ratio. This event is referred to as the Tron Independence Day. \n\n An apparent benefit of the TRX is its speed. The website states that TRX consistently handles 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), 24/7 compared to 25 TPS for Ether and 3-6 TPS for Bitcoin. Another benefit is that Tron removes the complication of building a new blockchain protocol from scratch by providing one on which developers can create and deploy their own decentralized applications (dApps). \n\n Tron\u2019s mainnet aims to \u2018heal the internet\u2019 through free and uncontrolled data, a content ecosystem where users can obtain digital assets from content spreading, a personal ICO feature with the ability to distribute digital assets, the infrastructure to allow distributed digital assets exchanges (such as games), and market forecasting. \n\n In 2019, Tron had dual headquarters in Beijing and San Francisco, and was planning to establish more overseas offices in preparation for rapid expansion. Its founder, Justin Sun, worked for two years as the chief representative and advisor to Ripple in greater China, helping it with its first successful round of funding. He also the founded PEIWO, a mobile social networking and voice streaming app. \n\n As of January 2019, around 98% of the 100 billion circulating supply of ERC-20 TRX had been burnt (destroyed) by the Tron foundation and its community. The burn only applied to the ERC-20 tokens, which are said to be \u2018old and useless\u2019 and not the newer Tron coins that are native to the Tron mainnet.",

Introduced in early 2018, TUSD is also the first cryptoasset built on the TrustToken platform.  According to the website, TrueUSD is the \u201cfirst regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar.\u201d\n\nTrustToken is an asset tokenization platform for people who want to trade physical assets on a blockchain.  Starting with the creation of stablecoins like TrueUSD, TrustToken hopes to eventually provide the technology and legal structure to tokenize and transact real-world assets on blockchains in a way that is legally enforced, audited, and collateralized.  \n\nThe TrustToken company was co-founded in 2017 by Jai An (CEO), Rafael Cosman (Head of Engineering and Product), Tory Reiss (Head of Partnerships and Business Development), and Stephen Kade.  Before TrustToken, An was a data scientist at Kernel, Cosman was a machine learning engineer at Google, Reiss did business development at Microsoft, and Kade was a cofounder of a startup called NeuroTechX.  At the time of this writing, the company is headquartered in San Francisco.\n\nIn June 2018, TrustToken raised $20 million to further develop the platform.  Investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund Angel (Pathfinder), Jump Trading Capital, Foundation Capital, Danhua Venture Capital (DHVC), Distributed Global, ZhenFund, Stanford-StartX, Signia Venture Partners, GGV Capital, and BlockTower Capital.\n\nTrueUSD is regulated by the Nevada Department of Business & Industry because it\u2019s US dollar holdings are stored in numerous bank accounts belonging to different trust companies in that state.  In addition, TrustToken is registered and regulated as a federal Money Service Business by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). \n\nUnlike BaseCoin and MakerDao which use algorithms to maintain price stability, TrueUSD keeps its value stable by being asset-backed.  New TUSD is minted when an escrow account receives US dollars.  When a token holder converts TUSD to USD, the commensurate amount of TrueUSD is immediately burned.  Both the creating and burning of TUSD occur automatically with smart contracts on the TrustToken platform.  In this way, the total supply of TrueUSD in circulation is always equal to the money in the escrow accounts.\n\nCohen & Company, a Maryland-based independent accounting firm, provides monthly audits of the collateralized funds held in the escrow accounts.  The results of Cohen & Company\u2019s examinations are published in monthly reports available on the TrustToken blog.\n\nIn April 2019, TrustToken launched five new cryptocurrency stablecoins: TrueGBP which is backed by the British pound, TrueAUD which is backed by Australian dollars, TrueEUR which is backed by Euros, TrueCAD which is backed by Canadian dollars, and TrueHKD which is backed by Hong Kong dollars.",

    "description": "UNI is a governance token issued by the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap. This is an automatic market maker working on the basis of smart contracts that create a liquidity pool for ERC20 tokens and implement the algorithm without using the orderbook. The official upgrade to Uniswap V2 took place in May 2020. The launch period coincided with the popularity of the yield farming that also contributed to the bigger popularity of the exchange.\n\nUniswap token platform\n\nThe launch of the platform took place in November 2018 by Hayden Adams who developed the service being inspired by the article published by Vitalik Buterin a year earlier. After contributing to a Uniswap liquidity pool, users get a pool token that also belongs to the group of ERC20 tokens. They have the same properties as other ERC20 tokens allowing users to exchange and sell them. It\u2019s possible to use them in other dApps as well. Each token is a tiny share of the liquidity pool with a trading fee of 0.3% included. As soon as holders of these tokens reclaim their funds, these tokens get burned.\n\nUsers who are going to use the Uniswap protocol should have an Ethereum address and a wallet that is suitable for storing ERC20 tokens. Nothing more is needed for swapping tokens as the transaction can be easily approved right in the wallet. Users should keep in mind that the swapping procedure requires additional fees when confirming the swap.\n\nThere is no need to worry about the prices when you deal with an automated market maker. The concept of orderbooks is entirely eliminated in this case. If the token has its own liquidity pool and smart token, any user can trade it and earn a fee of 0,3%, which is a fee for providing liquidity. The contribution to the liquidity pool requires having an equal value of ETH and ERC20 tokens.\n\nThere is a pricing mechanism \u201cConstant Product Market Maker Model\u201d at the basis of this decentralized exchange. The main activity of the platform is balancing out the tokens\u2019 value for swapping based on the demand.\n\nUNI token details\n\nOut of all UNI tokens that have been initially issued, 60% is allocated to the community, 21.5% to the team of the platform, and the remaining 18.5% to the investors and advisors.\n\nThe native Uniswap token was unveiled to the public on September 16, 2020. UNI token was created for protocol management. The token was immediately added by Coinbase after it was launched, which is the only token so far that was enlisted so fast, even before the auditing was conducted. Its price exploded 300% after Binance announced listing the cryptocurrency as well. UNI is traded on more than 50 platforms that hurried to add a popular token to their offers including such exchanges as Okex, Kucoin, Gemini, Bitfinex, FTX, Poloniex, etc. Such interest to the asset from the crypto community demonstrates a high level of trust in the decentralized platform that issued the token and high evaluation of its prospects on the market.\n\nUNI is an ERC20 token, therefore, any wallet that is suitable for Ethereum-based tokens can be used for storing UNI. A wide range of reliable hardware wallets is presented on the market that can store UNI such as Trezor One, Ledger Nano S that can be acquired for cold storage of your crypto assets. It\u2019s also possible to download a software Trust Wallet or Atomic wallet that has little or no access to the Internet for better security.\n\nUNI token distribution\n\nSince UNI token is a governance token, it entitles its holders to vote for the decisions that determine the future of the protocol and the platform. When Uniswap launched UNI, it was accompanied by airdropping 400 UNI tokens to all those holders who used Uniswap protocol at least once before September 2020. In this way, the platform distributed 150 million native tokens. Uniswap users claimed 66 million tokens in the first 24 hours after airdropping was announced. Each user could get 400 UNI and sell them immediately if they wanted to. The batch of 400 tokens was worth more than 1,200 USD at the date of the token release. The platform distributed 40% of all tokens in this way, planning to distribute the rest of the tokens within 4 subsequent years.\n\nExperts consider that such a distribution model was well-thought. It enables the team to play an important role in management when the project is young. The developers don\u2019t plan to take part directly in the development of the project in the future and only votes will determine the policy of the platform.\n\nThere is one nuance, though. Analysts at Glassnode questioned the decentralization of the Uniswap exchange, admitting that the project team deliberately did not disclose all the details of unlocking the tokens. In accordance with the announcement made by the developers, the tokens are distributed in the course of the first four years. Still, the team was reproached for lack of a clear public plan that can mean that tokens are actually not locked. For instance, Glassnode expressed its suspicions on the subject.\n\nThe distribution plan displays gradual vesting. However, the tokens allocated to the team and investors are kept on a regular ETH address without transfer restrictions, not locked in the vault for smart contracts management and distribution performed programmatically over time. The analysts say that such a method of storage gives users administrative rights in the protocol.\n \nThe other thing that deserves attention is the suboptimal management system, in which users need to have 1% of tokens to complete an offer. Since not all tokens have been released into circulation yet at the time of writing, Glassnode estimates the real share of required UNIs under current conditions at 8%. The only entity that has the required number of tokens so far is the Binance exchange, which is a centralized exchange and a business rival of Uniswap. In case someone manages to concentrate 10 million UNI in delegated votes and at least 40 million votes, the community-level governance becomes impossible.\n\nUniswap team\n\nThe founder and CEO Hayden Adams graduated from Stony Brook University, where he studied Mechanical Engineering. Hayden worked as an engineer at Siemens. The team of the platform is small and includes less than 10 employees.",

    "description": "Tether (\u20ae) (USD\u20ae) is a cryptocurrency with digital tokens designed to replicate the value of the United States Dollar. The theory is that this provides protection from the volatility of cryptocurrencies, so 1 USD\u20ae will always be worth $1. To achieve this Tether claims to have each token backed 100% by actual assets in the platform\u2019s reserve account. \n\n The origins of Tether came from a whitepaper published online in January 2012, in which software developer J.R. Willett described the possibility of building new currencies on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Credited with \u2018inventing the ICO\u2019 to fund the project, Willett went on to implement his idea in the form of the \u2018Mastercoin\u2019. The Mastercoin protocol became the technological foundation of the Tether platform. Tethers exist on blockchains using the Omni Protocol, and as ERC20 tokens. \n\n Two original members of the Mastercoin Foundation, Brock Pierce and Craig Sellars, became co-founders of Tether. Former child actor, Brock was a minor partner in a digital entertainment network that raised $88 million in venture capital in the 1990s. In 2013, he joined brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens in founding the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) which was reported to have raised $85 million in two venture funds by October 2017. \n\n Co-founder Craig Sellars started his career as a UX developer, worked in various engineering positions before presiding over a number of wireless operations. His first foray into the blockchain space was at Tether, later becoming CTO of exchange Bitfinnex for a year and a half. Since then he has held a variety of roles as co-founder, technologist, facilitator, and advisor for several blockchain projects and companies including vAtomic, Unsung, Fuzo, Factom, Synereo, Tau Chain and the MaidSafe Foundation. He is the founder of the Omni Foundation which developed the protocol used by Tether. \n\n Reeve Collins, the third co-founder, launched several ventures before Tether, including Traffic Marketplace, one of the first online ad networks to be acquired by Vivendi Universal, RedLever, a branded entertainment studio, acquired by Adconion Media Group, and Pala Interactive, where he secured $70 million to create a legal, real-money gambling site in the US. \n\n Tether was incorporated in Hong Kong with offices in Switzerland. In January 2015, the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex enabled Tether trading on its platform. Bitfinex officials Philip Potter and Giancarlo Devasini were responsible for setting up Tether Holdings Limited in the British Virgin Islands in 2014. A spokesperson for Bitfinex and Tether stated that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde was also the CEO of both firms at the time.",

Assembling an alliance of e-commerce platforms, Terra has over 45 million users at the time of writing.  \n\nThe project was developed by Terraform Labs, a Singapore-based company.  It offered a cryptocurrency-related technology that is gaining in popularity with merchants and users in South Korea.  The technology helps to shorten the settlement time from days to six seconds.  At the time of writing, Terraform\u2019s payment rails execute over 90,000 transactions every day.  The consumers may not be even aware of the fact that blockchain and stablecoins are involved when they buy things online or at the local shops.  \nThe team of developers announced their plans to implement an interchain solution for the major blockchains and they plan to do it with Solana and Ethereum.  \n\nTerra platform\n\nThe Terra platform is governed by the Tendermint consensus that is fulfilled by more than 100 validators, which secure the stable work of the blockchain with their bonded Luna stakes.  Thanks to the efforts of blockchain validators the platform can process hundreds of transactions per second.  \n\nTerra launched TerraSwap in November 2020.  This is an automatic market maker and a decentralized exchange that was developed by Terra validator Delight Labs.  It opened new possibilities for DeFi apps built on the Terra blockchain.  Terra\u2019s financial infrastructure is powered by several stablecoins pegged to major fiat money.  The mathematical algorithm is used for the stability of the ecosystem.  \n\nA Terra Community Console was added to the ecosystem, which is a real-time metrics dashboard for the Terra blockchain.  It employs engaging visuals reflecting essential onchain data points to help traders to see a comprehensive picture.  \n\nThe products include Station Extension that is a browser extension for access to the Terra ecosystem and blockchain.  It performs the same function as Metamask for Ethereum.  The blockchain became mobile-friendly with the addition of the mobile app Station Mobile, which is a multi-featured blockchain wallet giving customers access to the dashboard with swaps, staking, and other things.  \n\nThe platform has its own knowledge base that is known as the Engineering Bay.  It includes the library of standardized smart contracts, guidelines, testing frameworks, and tons of useful tools for developers.  \n\nIn December 2020, Terra launched its Mirror Protocol, which is a synthetic asset platform that allows tracking, issuing and trading of real-world assets via Mirrored Assets also called mAssets.  They are tied to real-world assets mirroring their exchange prices, on-chain.  The protocol expands the adoption of UST by means of minting and swapping mAssets on Terra.\n\nTerra technologies\n\nSmart contracts used by the exchange are supported by WebAssembly providing safety and portability to their execution.  The software is known for its compactness and optimization possibility that makes it perfect for the cross-chain operation of the blockchain.  \n\nWith Columbus-3 and Columbus-4 mainnet upgrades, the company wants to bring extensive smart contract functionality to the platform.  Columbus-4 enables the members of the community to create and upload smart contracts on the blockchain providing transparency to fully decentralized agents.  In this way, the developers are able to work over their decentralized apps taking advantage of the Terra blockchain that include such features as oracle prices, on-chain swaps, and native stablecoins.  Columbus-4 allows using various features on the blockchain.  With its help, the developers plan to add a mint module and a message authorization module.  \n\nThe technologies used by the exchange also include the development framework Houston that was created for CosmWasm smart contracts.  The framework delivers many interesting features including network management for deployment of numerous public and private networks.\n\nTerra develops interoperability of the Terra ecosystem with Axelar, the decentralized protocol that breaks down barriers between the chains using its protocol suite.  The integration with Terra enables users to bridge the assets issued by the native platform right from their wallets.  In partnership with the open-source platform Hummingbot, a custom arbitrage bot for the execution was created.  It enables the execution of arbitrage trades between TerraSwap and other centralized and decentralized platforms.  Working with Velo Labs, the platform tries to power an advanced payment system via the integration with the Velo Protocol.  The goal is to extend blockchain technology to crossbody payments in the Asian region and to develop synergistic blockchain payment solutions to cater to the needs of companies including small and medium-sized businesses.  \n\nTerra USD \n\nComparing their product with other stablecoins, the developers are sure that there is no coin in the market which is scalable enough to fit all blockchain ecosystems.  They assert that Terra USD is the first stablecoin of this type.  Among other characteristics that add value to the asset are its interchain and yield bearing features.  Even DAI, which is one of the most popular decentralized stablecoins on Ethereum, has some serious issues with scaling.  It is caused by supply-demand mismatch in the monetary policy of stablecoins when minting expenditures surpass the value of digital asset minted.\n\nContrary to the stablecoins on Ethereum with their scalability problem, Terra USD features infinite scalability.  This is an algorithmic stablecoin.  It is required to burn 1 USD worth of LUNA token to mint 1 TerraUSD.  The scalability of Terra USD monetary policy can reveal the potential of DeFi apps and protocols.  It\u2019s worth noting that stablecoin has its Korean sibling that functions successfully.  It is a rather popular payment solution in Asia that expanded to e-commerce checkouts.  \n\nThe startup raised over 100 million USD in total.  The goal of the company is to spend these funds for the expansion in the Asian region, for instance, into Thailand and Taiwan, and to develop new services on the platform.  The round co-led by Mike Novogratz and his Galaxy Digital also attracted funds from Coinbase Ventures and Pantera Digital.  \n\nTerra team \n\nCo-founder and CEO Do Kwon was the founder and CEO of Anify Inc, the company working on peer-to-peer connectivity solutions using mesh network technology for scalability, accessibility, and security of telecommunications.

    "description": "VeChain Thor (VET) is a cryptocurrency and smart contracts platform focused on enterprise use. It utilizes IoT technology (like NFC chips, RFID trackers, and QR codes) and connects them to a single distributed ledger.  According to the VeChain Foundation, partnerships have been developed with companies in several industries including luxury goods, automotive, agriculture, logistics, food/drug, and governments.\n\nSunny Lu, former Chief Information Officer of Louis Vuitton China, founded VeChain in 2015. Initially, VeChain launched as an ERC-20 token called VEN. In August 2017, VeChain held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) where 200,000 ETH was raised which was about $60 million at the time. \n\nOn June 30, 2018, VeChain released VeChain Thor on its own mainnet. With the roll-out of this independent blockchain, token holders swapped VEN for VET, at an exchange rate of 1:100. (VEN is no longer active.)\n\nThe VeChain Thor blockchain uses a dual token model. VET is the native token and functions as a store of value, whereas VTHO is used to pay for using and building apps on the blockchain. VTHO is automatically generated by owning VET. By using a dual token model, transaction fees remain more stable compared to a system where there is only one coin.\n\nThe VeChain Foundation, a Singapore based non-profit founded in 2017, maintains the VeChain Thor blockchain. \n\nInstead of using fully decentralized consensus models like PoW or PoS, new blocks on the VeChain Thor blockchain are validated via a \u201cProof-of-Authority\u201d (PoA) consensus algorithm. An innovation of the Proof of Stake model, PoA consensus uses identity and reputation as the form of stake instead of actual tokens. With VeChain Thor\u2019s version of PoA, 101 known validators (Authority Nodes) produce new blocks on the blockchain. Each Authority Node requires full KYC, a formal application, dedicated hardware for the Node, 250 million VET at a minimum, and ultimately selected by the VeChain Foundation.\n\nBecause the identities and reputations of the validators are at stake, it\u2019s argued that the validators will be held accountable and incentivized to work in the best interest of the network\u2019s growth and security. The benefit of using trusted validators is increased blockchain efficiency which allows for greater scalability and lower transaction fees while still remaining secure. \n\nThere is no mining on the VeChainThor blockchain. A 51% attack would require that 51 of the 101 validators collude with one another, which is unlikely. \n\nVeChain has a Blockchain-as-a-Service (\"BaaS\") platform called ToolChain. ToolChain is a blockchain platform offering services such as product lifecycle management, supply chain process control, data deposit, data certification, and process certification. ToolChain allows businesses of all sizes and technical abilities to utilize blockchain technology.\n\nVeChain has a number of impressive enterprise-grade partners including Walmart China, BYD, Renault, BMW, and PricewaterhouseCooper.\n\nVeChain is headquartered in Shanghai and has satellite offices in Singapore, Paris, Luxembourg, Palo Alto, Tokyo and Hong Kong.",

    "description": "Vertcoin (VTC) is an open-source peer-to-peer digital currency based on the Bitcoin protocol with such additional features as Stealth Address technology and ASIC resistant Proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm.  It was designed to make mining profitable for end-users when it\u2019s become obvious that Bitcoin can now only be obtained by specialized equipment (ASICs).  Unlike Bitcoin, Vertcoin can be mined on graphic cards (GPU) that are available for almost all PC owners.  It was created by a broad community of volunteers in 2014 as a hard fork of Litecoin which is in its turn a hard fork of Bitcoin.  Thus, in its functionality, Vertcoin represents a mixture of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.  Blockchain enthusiasts foresaw that BTC mining will be overtaken by centralized resources and invented their own way to bypass the threat of centralization, i.e. they have undertaken some measures to prevent the mining power from getting concentrated in the hands of a few.  ASIC-resistance is one of Vertcoin\u2019s key features that makes it incompatible with high-powered specialized equipment.  Vertcoin miner is available for any interested party to download on the project\u2019s website with a pretty simple installation guide.  In addition, the system is designed in such a way so as to prevent miners from joining into pools making sure that transactions are validated by a widely spread network of standalone users.  To bypass Bitcoin\u2019s problem with slow confirmation of transactions during the network\u2019s congestion, Vertcoin has implemented the technology called \u201csegregated witness\u201d.  It allows reducing the amount of data needed to verify each transaction and thus makes it possible to increase the network capacity.  Another forefront technology added by the project is the lightning network which is an off-chain solution making it possible to process a practically unmeasurable number of transactions per second.  Unlike many projects that emerged during the bullrun of 2017, Vertcoin didn\u2019t conduct an ICO, nor had a pre-mine, neither had it offered any airdrops to its followers.  The only explicit goal behind the project\u2019s launch was to make mining available for broad masses.    The coin VTC can be stored on the native wallet Vertcoin-core which is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.  It is also supported by many other popular wallets such as Coinomi, Ledger and Trezor.  Of all the popular exchanges, the asset can be traded on just a few platforms including Poloniex, Upbit and Bittrex.  Its total supply equals to 84 million VTC.  In December 2018, Vertcoin fell victim to the 51% attack.  Someone took control over the majority of the network\u2019s hashing power which made it possible for them to conduct double-spend transactions.  The attacker changed a part of the transaction history and created a longer chain of blocks forcing the rest of miners to validate the new version.  This left the community questioning whether GPU-mined cryptocurrencies are capable of providing the network with the same level of security that Bitcoin\u2019s ASICs do and whether such an approach is viable at all.",

    "description": "Wanchain is a decentralized platform that provides its users with bank services such as loan origination, credit payments, asset exchanges, and transaction settlements based on digital assets.  To be more exact, Wanchain is a distributed financial market based on blockchain technologies, an alternative to traditional banking.\n\nWanchain key goals\n\nToday the number of digital assets and blockchains grows pretty fast, but an efficient and decentralized way to exchange values between them has not yet been found.  Cryptocurrency users have to download a great number of wallets and depend on centralized exchanges to handle all their financial matters.  This often involves risks and burdens.\n\nWanchain states its purpose to fix the problem of value transfers between various ledgers and blockchains.  According to the project\u2019s whitepaper, they strive to build a non-proprietary cross-chain protocol and a distributed ledger that records both cross-chain and intra-chain transactions.\n\nWith Wanchain, access to financial services will become easier and the costs will be reduced due to chains\u2019 linking.  Any person or organization can base its financial services on Wanchain.  Wanchain defines three major groups of use cases of interconnection between different blockchain ledgers: decentralized exchanges, asset management tools and ICO (Initial Coin Offering) platforms.   \n\nWanchain architecture\n\nAt its start, Wanchain was an Ethereum-based generic ledger, but at the time of writing, it is already an independent separate blockchain with its own mainnet that went live on January 18, 2018.\n\nThe Cross-Chain Communication Protocol is a centerpiece that sets the performance of the entire Wanchain network.  It provides the data transfer between other blockchains otherwise unconnected.  There are three basic functional modules which enable the cross-chain communication protocol running.  These are the registration module, the cross-chain transaction data transmission module and the transaction status query module.\n\nThe registration module registers the original chain and also keeps track of any asset transfer.  The cross-chain transaction data transmission module provides the performance of the cross-chain transaction.  The transaction status query module mainly performs as a monitoring tool for all cross-chain transactions.\n\nWAN token\n\nWan is the native utility token of Wanchain.  WAN is used as security deposits for cross-chain transactions and activates tokenized transactions on the network.\n\nThe ICO started on October 4, 2017, and was completed in only 12 minutes helping the team reach its hard cap of 35.7 million USD.  WAN tokens were initially offered as ERC-20 tokens to ICO participants, but then they were changed for tokens on the Wanchain mainnet via the token swap.\n\nThe total supply of WAN is 210 million.  It is distributed in the following way: 51% of tokens were sold via ICO, 20% are dedicated to the project team, 19% are allocated to the foundation, and 10% are intended to be used for the network support.\n\nWAN is not minable.  It can be traded on some exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, or Kucoin.  Users may receive, send, and store WAN tokens with the help of the Wanchain official wallet.  They may also use other wallets, such as Ledger Nano Wallet, Trezor, or Trust Wallet.\n\nWanchain team\n\nThe Wanchain Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 2017.  Headquartered in Singapore, the Company has its offices in Beijing, China, London, UK, and Austin USA.  Their remote employees work all around the world.\n\nJack Lu is the founder and CEO.  He is also a co-founder of two other companies, Wanglu Tech and Factom with 20+ years of experience as a software engineer.\n\nLi Ni is the VP of Business Development and Operations.  Previously he worked for ZTE Telecom, Delta Electronics, and SuperMap Software, having 18+ years of experience in IT and Internet businesses.\n\nWeijia Zhang is the VP of Engineering.  He is also an EEA Regional Head of China at Enterprise Ethereum Alliance with extensive R&D knowledge and engineering experience in blockchain, cognitive sciences, mental modeling.\n\nWanchain is open to the partnership.  In late 2017, Wanchain became a part of the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance (IOA).  The Alliance is backed by ICON, Aion, and Wanchain, and it has a significant influence on the blockchain industry, promoting interconnectivity between the isolated blockchain networks.",

    "description": "Waves is a blockchain platform that allows you to create your own custom token. According to its website, you can create your own token in less than a minute and use it for projects such as crowdfunding, loyalty reward programs, and in-app currencies. Tokens created on Waves have limited functionality compared to (for example) Ethereum, but are easier to create and require zero coding knowledge. \n\n The Waves coin (WAVES) is the platform\u2019s native currency. You can use WAVES to create a trading pair with your self-made coin on the Waves decentralized exchange (DEX). There are two ways to acquire the currency, you can either install the Waves client on your computer and use its DEX to exchange fiat, Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or you can acquire WAVES through a third-party centralized crypto exchange. \n\n The platform has a Miner Reward Token (MRT) which is awarded to miners or platform members who support them; MRT can also be traded on the open market. To become a miner, a user must have a minimum effective balance of 10,000 WAVES in a personal account. WAVES holders can support the work of miners and earn income without by loaning their balance of tokens to the miners. The miners earn commission from processing the transactions within the platform. \n\n The project was launched in 2016 by Ukrainian entrepreneur Alexander (Sasha) Ivanov, a Theoretical Physics graduate of Moscow State University who pursued postgraduate studies at Leipzig University, Germany. In the same year it launched, Waves held a successful ICO, raising $2 million in less than 24 hours and a total of over $16 million. \n\n The total WAVES token supply is 100 million. One million tokens were distributed to early supporters, one million were put aside for post-ICO bounties, four million were reserved for strategic partners and backers, nine million were withheld by the development team, and 85 million were distributed in the ICO. \n\n The Waves platform itself has been described as a cryptocurrency version of the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform. According to the ICObench tracker, there were around 100 crowdsales on Waves in March 2018 spanning 25 categories. The top two fundraising successes included mobile gaming platform MobileGo, which raised $53 million, and cryptographic pension asset platform Peerbanks, which raised $42.6 million. As of 2018, the Waves platform was most popular among Russian and North American projects. \n\n In September 2018, Waves introduced smart contract functionality to the platform. The new features include multi-sig addresses, token freezing, atomic swaps, and voting. Waves\u2019 smart contracts use a new programming language, RIDE, specifically made for the project. Waves\u2019 smart contracts do not require Gas to execute like (for example) Ethereum. Instead, the network charges a minimal flat fee.",

But the problems that plague the digital goods and trading community have stunted its growth far beneath its full potential.\n\nWAX is creating a full suite of blockchain-based tools that allows anyone to trade digital or even physical items instantly and securely, to anyone, anywhere.\n\nParticipants of the Worldwide Asset eXchange gain access to a global community of collectors and traders, buyers and sellers, creators and gamers, merchants, dApp creators, and game developers.\n\nWAX's target market for digital goods is a superset comprised of virtual items from video games ($140 billion in total sales, $50 billion in secondary trading volume) and potentially tokenized products from consumer e-commerce ($1.8 trillion of a global $2.8 trillion e-commerce market). In our calculation, we add the primary sales of video games and video game items and secondary virtual item sales because the WAX Platform supports both. The subset of products we see tokenizable is $1.8 trillion of the $2.8 trillion e-commerce market. Today, taken together, that's about a $2 trillion total market size for digital goods.\n\nThe problems that plague the digital goods and trading industries have stunted their growth far beneath their full potential. Sellers want to maximize their profits on items of any price. Buyers want assurance that the goods they\u2019re buying are authentic and that they\u2019re protected from unscrupulous sellers. But microtransactions are extremely uneconomical, guaranteed safe trades between strangers are impossible, customs and shipping costs are expensive for the seller or the buyer (or both), and authenticating rare collectibles is difficult.  \n\nWAX is solving these problems by creating a full suite of blockchain-based tools that allows anyone to buy, sell, or trade digital or physical items instantly and securely, to anyone, anywhere.\n\nWAX gives game publishers a way to monetize their customers who usually don't buy or spend money in their games. While non-paying players in free-to-play games spend enormous amounts of time in the game, publishers can start to offer NFTs through WAX. The brand affinity is high for players who then look for merchandise that reflects their interest. Different from an ad, this is a direct integrated shopping experience that can tie to game activity, promotions, or interact with streamers who create content related to the game. WAX believes this model, when proven through well-executed trials, will sweep through the entire video game industry to capture revenue from \"non-performing\" customers not spending money in their games. Currently, there are several game publishers currently working to roll out tests with WAX and vIRLs within their games.\nWAX is a purpose-built blockchain and protocol token designed to make e-commerce transactions faster, easier, and safer for all participants. The WAX Blockchain uses Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) as its consensus mechanism and is fully backward compatible with EOS. The custom features and incentive mechanisms developed by WAX are designed to optimize the blockchain's usability in e-commerce, and encourage voting on guilds and proposals.\n\nWAX has created a suite of blockchain-based tools upon which dApps, marketplaces, and native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are built. These tools include services to support e-commerce operations such as the WAX Cloud Wallet, SSO and OAUTH, a native RNG service, a developer portal, and more. The resulting technology represents a blockchain architecture with 500 millisecond block times, is fee-less for customers, and leverages voting rewards to incentivize participation in the selection of block producers and proposals.\n\nThe co-founders of WAX include William Quigley. Since 1998, he has worked as the Managing Director at Clearstone Venture Partners, an independent venture capital firm listing several dozens of successful projects that they have raised over the years. William has also helped many cryptocurrency-oriented companies build up their businesses including Tether, Mastercoin, and GoCoin.\n\nHe has incubated and invested in over 40 Bitcoin, blockchain and crypto currency related investments. Quigley co-founded many transformative crypto companies including Tether, a USD derivative adopted by many of the world's leading crypto exchanges and GoCoin, a pioneering crypto payments processor. He and his business partner were early backers and the largest investors in Mastercoin, the technical forerunner to Ethereum and the world's first ICO. The Mastercoin team invented the concept of a blockchain based smart contract. Prior to forming Cashel, William co-founded Clearstone Venture Partners, a $700 million early stage focused venture capital firm where he concentrated on Internet investments. He also co-founded the world's first consumer Internet venture capital firm, idealab Capital Partners, and led Internet incubation efforts at idealab, the most successful consumer Internet incubator of the Web 1.0 era.",

    "description": "NEM is a dual-layer blockchain similar to Ethereum but written in Java, a popular programming language; its native cryptocurrency is XEM. The platform describes itself as a \u2018smart asset blockchain\u2019 which allows developers to build a number of decentralized applications (dApps) for fintech, logistics, Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), and peer-to-peer payments. \n\n NEM stands for New Economy Movement, the premise of the platform is that it combines learnings from other cryptos (such as Bitcoin) with academic research in network theory. Its key advantage is its modular Smart Asset System, which enables businesses to replicate almost any business transaction on the blockchain with minimal development. Because NEM was created using Java, most programs can be easily adapted to utilize the network. It is sometimes described as a blockchain-based cloud platform. \n\n The founding vision of the protocol was to create a system that would give power to users, rather than coin hoarders and mining companies. One of the issues with the Proof of Work system used by Bitcoin (and many others) is that in order to mine tokens, you must use computational power; the greater your machine\u2019s power, the greater the chance of earning coins. \n\n This has lead to a system where only those who can afford the latest and most expensive mining machines are able to profit, while the average person is not able to compete or contribute. Miners of larger amounts also have a tendency to hoard their coins without contributing to the system and if the amount they hold is large enough, they can gain control of the token network. \n\n To ensure a fairer system XEM cannot be mined or staked. Instead, the currency is harvested through the Proof of Importance (POI) algorithm and uses Delegated Harvesting to determine who can vest the next block. NEM\u2019s POI system takes into account how much XEM a participant holds and whether they have actively helped the economy by transacting with others. Each user is given a trust score, the higher it is, the more chance they have of being rewarded. \n\n To begin vesting coins, a participant must place at least 10,000 unvested XEM coins in an approved XEM wallet. Over time, XEM coins pay out dividends (interest) and trust scores increase, as long as there is a balanced transaction history and the holder contributes to the community. \n\n There are 8,999,999,999 XEM in total, 75% of the coins were issued evenly to nearly 3,000 stakeholders after the launch of the genesis block on March 31, 2015. The remaining 25% of XEM was allocated to marketing and development expenses. The equal distribution is to ensure that no one can control the price or gain an advantage over others since each stakeholder only controls about 0.025% of the currency. \n\n The initial framework of NEM was laid out by an anonymous Bitcoin Talk forum user called UtopianFuture in 2014. By July 2018 the organization had grown to include the NEM Foundation and headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which serve as an incubator, accelerator, co-working space.",

    "description": "Stellar is a platform that connects banks, payments systems and people, helping them to move money across borders at almost no cost. It acts as a bridge facilitating the low-cost trading of fiat currencies, particularly in cases where there might not be a large direct market. \n\n The native asset of the Stellar network is the Lumen (XLM). Lumens are used to pay transaction fees on the platform and act as a security measure that mitigates DoS attacks that attempt to generate large numbers of transactions or consume large amounts of space in the ledger. The asset also plays an anti-spam role, as all user accounts must hold a minimum of 0.5 Lumen, discouraging abandoned accounts and ensuring that they all have economic utility. \n\n In 2014, when the network launched, the native asset was also called \u2018Stellar\u2019 but was renamed \u2018Lumen\u2019 in 2015 to prevent confusion. The supply of Lumens is governed by strict protocol-level rules. At launch 100 billion were created and every year new Lumens are added to the network at an inflation rate of 1%. \n\n The platform and development of the network are run by the Stellar Development Foundation, a non-profit and non-stock fund. The founders of the fund can neither benefit from its operation or from the sale of its shares. \n\n After launch, the foundation announced its intentions to distribute 50% of the total number of Lumens to each unique individual who signed up through an invitation. Partners such as businesses, governments, institutions, or nonprofit organizations that contribute to the growth and adoption of the Stellar ecosystem were allocated 25%. A further 20% was given away to Bitcoin and XRP holders over two distribution rounds in 2017, and 5% is reserved for operational expenses. As of January 2018, 8 billion Lumens had been given away. \n\n Stellar is an open-source, distributed payments infrastructure, meaning that anyone can build an app or financial product on top of it. It was developed to provide the opportunity for new organizations to extend financial access to unserved communities by ensuring participants record transactions correctly. IBM\u2019s blockchain division, for example, partnered with Stellar in 2017 and use Lumens as a unit of account for their banking payments infrastructure. \n\n Like all blockchain platforms, Stellar consists of a number of servers (or nodes) around the world which keep a record of every account and transaction in the network and store the records in a ledger. The properties of the ledger can only be changed when all servers reach a consensus that the change meets the protocol criteria. \n\n The company was founded by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. Jed is an American programmer and entrepreneur who founded and served as the CTO of Ripple until 2013 and is known for creating the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. In January 2018, McCaleb's Ripple token ownership was reported to be worth $20 billion, putting him in 40th place in Forbes' list of world's richest people. \n\n After beginning her career as an attorney, Joyce was a venture capitalist at Freestyle Capital. She co-founded SimpleHoney, a mobile commerce startup, and was CEO of Soompi, an English language website providing coverage of Korean pop culture. She resigned as Executive Director of Stellar in 2016. \n\n Stellar was based on the initial Ripple protocol and model. After systemic problems with Ripple\u2019s existing consensus algorithm were discovered, Stellar created an updated version of the protocol with a new consensus algorithm. Both platforms have many common traits, however Stellar is known to be more opensource and decentralized.",

Although it offers the option of transparency, it is typically known for its use of privacy technologies such as ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obscure the origins, amounts, and destinations of transactions. \n\n You can buy Monero from an exchange or from an individual. Alternatively, you can mine Monero to get coins from the block reward. Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Unlike Bitcoin, where people can see exactly how much money is being sent from one user to another, Monero hides this information to protect user privacy. Monero also features a dynamic block size and dynamic fees, an ASIC-resistant proof of work, and a tail coin emission. \n\n Monero\u2019s Kovori is an anonymized router which integrates I2P technology and has been under development since 2015. The project will improve the privacy of the network by hiding the IP addresses of those who wish to interact with the Monero blockchain. \n\n Due to the stringent privacy features, Monero experienced rapid market capitalization growth in 2016, far surpassing that of other cryptocurrencies. This was reportedly due to its adoption by the darknet market and rightwing extremists. \n\n Monero is an open source project maintained by a group of core developers and a community of open source contributors and researchers. There are no public details about the founders in the public space; the first whitepaper with a focus on the CryptoNote protocol was written by Nicolas van Saberhagen (assumed to be a pseudonym). In 2018, it was widely reported in the crypto press that Monero had 7 members, 49 developers, and 3 researchers, with the unofficial figurehead of \u2018pseudonymous Luigi\u2019. \n\n In 2017, there was some controversy about a Javascript mining software called Coinhive which generates a script allowing websites or apps to access a visitor's Central Processing Unit and mine Monero. The site or app owner gets a percentage of the coins mined while visitors are consuming content on their site. Coinhive did not require the third-parties to tell visitors that their computers were being accessed and their electricity consumed in exchange for a site visit. \n\n Monero suffered another PR issue in 2018 when hackers took advantage of weak code to manipulate the amount of XMR shown in a wallet, before convincing exchanges to pay out. \n\n A team of researchers from a broad collection of institutions, including Princeton, Carnegie Mellon, Boston University, MIT, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, also claim that a token\u2019s movements on Monero are not as obscured as they seem and that it is possible to extract information on individual transactions.",

Ripple aims to connect banks and payment providers to provide a frictionless experience for sending and receiving money globally. It was originally designed as a day-to-day payment system, to speed up and reduce the costs of transactions, and provide a mediatory currency for exchanges and conversions with minimum commission. \n\n Software developer Ryan Fugger founded the original Ripple project in 2004. The core idea behind the protocol was a peer-to-peer trust network of financial relations that would replace banks. Based on the premise that money is simply a bank\u2019s promise of value, he aimed to create a monetary system where the promise of an individual held just as much weight. His concept was launched in 2005 as RipplePay, a financial service allowing users to extend credit lines to friends and family and make secure payments in traditional and online currencies. \n\n In 2012, Jed McCaleb, an American programmer and entrepreneur, along with Chris Larsen, an angel investor and startup executive, approached Ryan with a digital currency idea. Jed had been working on a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network. After discussions, Ryan handed over the reins to Jed and Chris, who co-founded the corporation OpenCoin, to develop the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. The company later changed its name to Ripple Labs. \n\n The Ripple platform is similar to Ethereum in that it has its a native currency (XRP) but is also open-source, allowing users to build their own assets and products on top of the existing platform. Ripple uses its proprietary patented technology, the \u2018Ripple protocol consensus algorithm\u2019 (RPCA), to verify transactions. It is argued that XRP is not technically a cryptocurrency because it is controlled by one company and transactions are processed by its network of approved validators. \n\n Ripple released its XRP token in January 2013. Like traditional cryptocurrencies, it is based on a public chain of cryptographic signatures. The company initially set the supply of XRP at 100 billion of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense. \n\n XRP enhances Ripple\u2019s software by acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currencies, providing liquidity and speeding up cross-border transactions; however, it is not essential to the network and doesn\u2019t have to be used. \n\n RippleNet is what Ripple calls the network of financial institutions using its products. There are three core segments: xCurrent for processing payments, xRapid to source liquidity, and xVia to connect to the network and send payments.",

    "description": "Tezos is a smart contract platform with an on-chain governance model. It claims to be the world\u2019s first self-evolving blockchain and its main premise is the ability to integrate new technology into the ledger as it becomes available. Its native utility token XTZ (known as Tez or Tezzies) launched on June 24, 2017, at a price of approximately $3 per coin. \n\n Self-amendment allows Tezos to upgrade itself without having to split or fork the network into two different blockchains. This avoids divisions in the community that can disrupt the network, reduces execution costs for upgrades, and allows future innovation to be seamlessly implemented. \n\n The Tezos blockchain protocol is a delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) system that supports Turing complete smart contracts. It is implemented in OCaml, a functional programming language that offers speed, an unambiguous syntax and semantics, and formal proofs of correctness. \n\n Tezos allows all stakeholders to participate in the on-chain governance of the protocol through an election cycle, which provides a formal and systematic procedure to reach agreements on amendments. Upgrades to Tezos are staged through a testing environment to allow stakeholders to recall potentially problematic updates should they arise. Tezos developers can propose protocol upgrades in exchange for contribution rewards. \n\n The PoS system means that all validations are conducted virtually, not physically, and does not require mining hardware and large amounts of electricity; the process is called \u2018baking\u2019 as opposed to \u2018mining.\u2019 You can acquire XTZ through the \u2018baking\u2019 model by signing and appending a block of transactions to the Tezos blockchain. \n\n There are two types of accounts that exist on the Tezos blockchain: originated accounts and implicit accounts. Originated accounts can\u2019t take part in the baking process, and must instead assign a delegate (with an implicit account) to bake on their behalf. Implicit accounts can participate in the Tezos baking process, as long as the account has been registered as a delegate. \n\n XTZ holders of both kinds of accounts can participate in the consensus mechanisms that keep the chain functioning and receive rewards for doing so through the \u2018delegating\u2019 process. A standard unit of Tezos for baking is a roll of 10,000 coins. A baker stands a higher chance of being able to bake or endorse a block if they have a larger number of rolls. An originated account holder who delegates coins to a baker receives an annualized yield (like interest). \n\n The project is the vision of Arthur Breitman, a French-born mathematician and computer scientist with a background working for large corporates like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The project\u2019s co-founder and Breitman\u2019s wife, Kathleen, has previous experience in the financial sector, having previously worked for renowned companies such as Bridgewater Associates and R3. \n\n After failing to raise funds from banks and investors through the USA registered company Dynamic Ledger Solution, Inc. (DLS), the Breitmans raised funds through an ICO in July 2017. It was an unprecedented success, raising 66,000 Bitcoin and 361,000 Ether (equal at the time to $232 million) in the space of only 13 days. \n\n This fundraising was soon followed by several controversies, including internal board member disputes and several class-action lawsuits. The Tezos foundation, however, went on to successfully launch its beta network in 2018. The first exchanges to list XTZ for trade were Gate.io and HitBTC, where it quickly became a popular coin. \n\n In 2018, Tezos announced funding for TezTech, a Tezos-focused software shop with several projects underway, including a trustless scaling and custody solution, and API and software libraries.",

    "description": "Verge (XVG) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.  Originally created in 2014 as DogeCoinDark, it rebranded to Verge in 2016.  Verge utilizes multiple tools to enhance privacy including Tor (open-source anonymity software) and an anonymous network layer called I2P.  The project claims that locations, IP addresses, and transaction details are obfuscated. \n\nAt the time of writing, there are two wallets that can store Verge: the QT wallet and the Electrum wallet.  Electrum, an open-source Bitcoin lite wallet, was forked by the Verge team and updated so that it could work with the Verge blockchain.  The Verge Electrum wallet is focused on speed.  It uses a technology called, Simple Payment Verification (SPV), which verifies transactions on the Verge blockchain without downloading the whole blockchain.  According to the website, with SPV, average transaction confirmation times take approximately 5 seconds.  The QT wallet requires that users download the full Verge blockchain.  It has built-in TOR integration and SSL encryption which obscures user IP addresses.  \n\nIn January 2018, the project released the Wraith Protocol upgrade.  The Wraith Protocol is a technology that enables users to shift between public and private ledgers on the Verge blockchain.  This means that when transparency is required (e.g., charging customers for regular purchases), a public ledger can be used.  For situations that need anonymity (e.g., sending confidential financial support to an NGO operating in a hostile political environment), then a private ledger can be utilized.\n\nVerge uses five different proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms for mining - 1) Scrypt, 2) X17, 3) Lyra2rev2, 4) myr-groestl, and 5) blake2s.  Not only does this allow more people with different types of mining equipment to be able to mine Verge, but (theoretically) it should also provide greater security through decentralization.\n\nVerge was founded by Justin Erik Valo (a.k.a. Sunerok) who, at the time of this writing, continues as the project\u2019s lead developer.  According to the website, \u201cAll contributors, including the Core Team, are unpaid volunteers who donate their time and energy into the project because they are passionate and believe in Verge.\u201d\n\nIn November 2017, 125 million XVG were lost by a wallet app service (CoinPouch) that was recommended by the Verge core team.  While CoinPouch blamed Valo (Verge\u2019s lead developer), Valo turned around and blamed CoinPouch for the incident.\n\nIn April 2018, Verge announced a partnership with Pornhub which, at the time of this writing, is in the top 40 for the most visited sites in the world.  Customers can use XVG to pay for all on-demand products and services.  According to Pornhub, a crypto payment method was one of the most requested features by its users. \n\nIn April 2018, the Verge network fell victim to a 51% attack.  In PoW based blockchains, if a miner (or mining pool) captures 51% or more of the network's mining power, they have the ability to double-spend (spend coins that were already spent).  Because the Verge blockchain switches between five different mining algorithms between each block, the attacker found a way to falsify the timestamps of the blocks and mined them with only one algorithm.  To exclude the blocks the attacker already minded, the Verge team implemented a hard fork quickly after the hack was discovered.",

    "name": "WhiteCoin",
    "description": "Whitecoin is a decentralized global public chain that is focused on cybersecurity and the fast speed of transactions.  It is based on an open-source innovative protocol called Multi Tunnel Blockchain Communication Protocol (MTBCP), a P2P communication protocol supporting the transmission of cross-chain information.  It employs a Proof-of-Stake algorithm for the security of the network.  \n\nThe platform uses Turing complete smart contract for support of the asset certification, OTC on the chain.  The use of the underlying virtual machine enables the interconnection of chains within the Whitecoin ecosystem removing the barriers between them.  Theoretically, the system can perform high-load transactions on numerous chains with a speed of up to 10,000 tps.\n\nWhitecoin background\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the history of its development wasn\u2019t smooth.  The rough start is explained by the disappearance of its key developer after launch.  It ruined all plans and the team failed to transfer the project into the PoS phase.  It affected the reputation of the project considerably, and the native cryptocurrency of the project was almost lost.  However, later the platform with its ideas still attracted the attention of investors who decided to persist and achieve the result.  Developers got down to work again to work on the cryptocurrency further.  \n\nThe members of the team keep on working over the project no matter what happens.  They are community-oriented and always try to enhance the code of the decentralized protocol that is not controlled by anybody.  All participants who are involved in it perform as volunteers.    \n\nWhitecoin platform\n\nWhitecoin token is an important part of the Whitecoin ecosystem that functions along with the Whitecoin wallet, Whitecoin Axis, decentralized mining pools, and cross-chain infrastructure that is based upon smart contract platforms.  The main characteristic of the Whitecoin project is a 100% reserve fund that supports the vitality of the ecosystem.\n\nThe platform has developed its own operating software called WhiteOS for customizing the Ubuntu environment to deliver portability for XWC coins.  The blockchain also uses its own technology for the secure handling of transactions.  \n\nEach digital asset anchored to Whitecoin and dubbed WAMP has its original chain asset and assets without foundation are not added to the platform managed by Robust Proof of Stake (RPOS) consensus.  In accordance with it, the block is generated every 6 seconds in the Whitecoin chain.  That is a very good result compared to block production in other blockchains.  For instance, it takes 10 minutes for BTC and 2,5 minutes for Litecoin.  \n\nThe community participation means much for the project as it works through a complicated organizational structure known as WhiteCoin General Assembly.  It makes reviews of proposals made by network operators and prepares reports on the work that was conducted including the developments that were made within a certain timeframe.  The hierarchy on the platform is minimal and was made for higher efficacy of the project.  \n\nThe platform offers simple communication tools as the system was developed to alleviate the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies for users.  It is even easy to mine the cryptocurrency even using the old computer as the system requirements are low.\n\nWhitecoin token\n\nThe platform has its native coin, XWC token that was launched on April 13th, 2014.  It\u2019s possible to employ different services using Whitecoin with the goal to make daily monetary transactions easier.  Besides, the asset is suitable for those who prefer to preserve anonymity during transactions.  \n\nThe project didn\u2019t have an ICO before launch.  XWC total supply is 248 million tokens.  The platform arranges bounty events from time to time.\n\nThe confirmation time is much lower due to the faster mining of the block.  There are no complicated mining requirements when XWC coins are created.  It\u2019s not even necessary to have a stable Internet connection and high-performance servers for proper Whitecoin performance.   \nIt\u2019s possible to earn XWC for users if they stake the minimum of 5 XWC keeping their wallet open for the security of the network.  The platform always compares the cryptocurrency with Bitcoin emphasizing the fast speed of its work, which is the main benefit of the digital asset along with anonymity and security that enter the list of advantages.  \n\nIt\u2019s also possible to run your wallet with the help of WhiteNote, which is a highly optimized image for the Raspberry Pi that uses minimal hardware requirements.  It helps to reduce the consumption of resources and deliver an affordable and cheap solution to the safe staking of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe use of the PoS model is very convenient for the exchange of services and goods without revealing the identity of the parties in a deal.  Stakers of XWC coins can get a 5% annual interest rate.   \n\nWhiteOS version and the latest wallet can be installed on a USB disk so it\u2019s portable though there are other installation options as well.  XWC can be acquired on such exchanges as Xchange.me, Bittrex, ASBTC, and some other platforms.  You can find a full list of platforms offering the token on the official website of the project.  Those who want to spend fiat money to acquire the cryptocurrency should apply to IndaCoin for that.  On the whole, there are over 300 cryptocurrencies that are traded against XWC cryptocurrency at the time of writing.  \n\nWhitecoin security\n\nThe transactions performed with the assistance of this blockchain are anonymous and untraceable for senders and receivers of funds.  The participants don\u2019t have to provide the identifying information to become members of the community.  At this, the transactions are transparent and are audited via a transparent ledger without revealing the identity of the participants.  \n\nWhitecoin team\n\nThe executive director of Whitecoin is Raymond de Jong from the Netherlands, North Holland Province.  Being a senior PHP programmer, he admires the values of the blockchain saying that a combination of security, stability, and growth provided by the project is a guarantee of future technological development and success.  His work is mentioned in his profile as a volunteer experience.  He has been working on the project since he entered the project in April 2014.  It is known only that the team includes specialists from Turkey, Amsterdam, and other countries of Europe.",

    "description": "Zcoin is an open-source digital cryptocurrency that implements a secure protocol providing financial anonymity to the members of its community.  The platform uses Proof-of-Work consensus and the Lyra2z hashing algorithm.  In addition to that, one of the main benefits of the system is its Zero-Knowledge proofs that are able to show ownership of a Zcoin not revealing which coin every given user has in possession.\n\nZcoin puts financial privacy at the forefront making transactions entirely untraceable.  Though the real identities of the individuals behind transactions are hidden in the Bitcoin system, it is still possible to identify users by analyzing transactions on the blockchain.  Zcoin removes the possibility of linking bitcoin addresses to web entities and enables fully anonymous currency transactions by implementing a cryptographic extension to Bitcoin.   \n\nThe project was launched by a Bangkok-based company on September 29, 2016.  In 2018, Zcoin helped to arrange the Thai Democrat Party's elections, which were held on its blockchain with over 127,000 votes cast nationwide.  Starting from 2019, Zcoin is accepted at any of the 5 million merchants registered via Thailand's nationwide QR code system through the Satang App.\n\nThe goal of the project\n\nStriving to increase individual liberty, the project helps to ensure freedom of commerce by guaranteeing financial privacy.  The mission of the team is to create the highest level of anonymity.  One doesn\u2019t have to trust the third parties in mixing transaction when using Zcoin .\n\nThe founder of the project considers that BTC holders can face a serious privacy problem as governments and law enforcement agencies have made substantial strides in using metadata and pattern analysis to find out the real-world identities of Bitcoin holders.  In fact, Bitcoin is considerably limited in terms of privacy as BTC transaction logs are entirely public, this is why the Zcoin team developed a cryptocurrency solving the problem.  The technology doesn\u2019t change the security model of Bitcoin but integrates cryptographic construction to the core code.\n\nHow Zcoin works\n\nIn order to mint a new coin, a user burns it with the further generation of a mathematical proof that it was burnt.  Using the proof, the person is able to redeem a new coin while the previous transaction history becomes clean.  The main point is that the proof doesn\u2019t contain data of the minted coin, therefore it\u2019s impossible to establish a link between the coin that was minted and a new coin that was redeemed.  Consequently, there\u2019s no information for analysis and a person can feel protected.\n\nZcoin technology\n\nZerocoin protocol is considered to be one of the most groundbreaking academic developments in Bitcoin research.  Initially, it was developed to be an extension of Bitcoin, but when it wasn\u2019t adopted by the community it was released as a separate coin and a separate blockchain.  It is attractive for users who value privacy as it enables expenditures without referring to their identity or transaction history.\n\nThe idea for the Zerocoin protocol was introduced by professor Matthew Daniel Green from Johns Hopkins University who developed it together with his two graduate students: Ian Miers and Christina Garman.  After the proposed improvement couldn\u2019t gain consensus, Poramin Insom released a blockchain using this idea.  Actually, it functions just like Bitcoin but applies the minting procedure before the assets are spent.\n\nThen the Sigma protocol was released in July 2019 to be used instead of the Zerocoin protocol.  It removed the necessity of a trusted setup.  This was the last thing that caused controversy as far as security was concerned.  Previously, the users had to believe that the setup was done properly to trust it.  So a new protocol improved security and provided a unique advantage to the coin.  \n\nThe work over protocol is still going on at the time of writing.  This protocol is only a precursor of the next generation privacy protocol called Lelantus.  Zcoin cryptographer Aram Jivanyan is developing it to improve the functionality of the current protocol.  The next version will remove the need for fixed denominations in minting and spending.\n\nZcoin became the first coin to implement Merkle Tree Proofs on its network for egalitarian mining, as well as the Dandelion protocol which protects user identities by preventing their IP addresses from being tied to a transaction.  Tech-savvy users are able to earn the bounties on the platform given for various tasks, such as Zcoin core development, web development, graphic design, marketing, etc.\n\nZcoin token\n\nZcoin is an ERC20 coin that was released in October 2016.  Being based on Bitcoin, Zcoin initially planned to create 21 million coins.  But the bug in the code brought to the creation of additional 388,450 coins.  After its fixing, the max supply was established at 21.4 million XZC.  \n\nXZC is traded on such exchanges as AEX, Binance, Bittrex, Cryptopia, Upbit, CoinEx, MXC, Huobi Global, DigiFinex, CHAOEX, and others.  The coin doesn\u2019t have an official desktop GUI wallet, but Electrum Light Wallet can be used to keep it.  Also, Coinomi, Cobo Wallet, Trust Wallet or some other mobile wallets can be used.\n\nZcoin team\n\nThe founder of the project is Poramin Insom who worked under the guidance of Matthew Green (the author of the idea the platform is based on) at Johns Hopkins University.  Previously, Poramin worked over Vertcoin but seeing the demand for anonymous crypto transactions he switched to Zcoin.  Though he is fully concentrated on work over Zcoin, he still plans to return to Vertcoin in the future.\n\nThe lead developer of the team is Peter Shugalev who has a Master Degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Moscow State University.  He is an author of the programming language used in a signature-based intrusion detection systems.\n\nThe COO of the company Reuben Yap has shaped the vision and direction of the project.  He had been working as a corporate lawyer for 10 years before he joined the team in 2016.  He is responsible for business processes in Zcoin.  Being a proponent of privacy, he also established a VPN service that is very popular in Southeast Asia.",

    "description": "Zcash (ZEC or \u24e9), also known as Zerocash, is a decentralized digital currency with privacy at its core. The asset comes in two forms: shielded and transparent. Although transaction data is posted to the blockchain like Bitcoin, a shielded protocol allows transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver, or transaction amount. The zero-knowledge proof constructions leveraged by Zcash are called zk-SNARKs (which stands for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge). \n\n Zcash includes selective disclosure features which allow users to reveal a degree of transaction information for compliance or audit purposes. It is also possible to execute completely transparent transactions to accommodate wallets and exchanges that do not support the privacy features. \n\n According to the website, the platform was built by top cryptographers based on the research of scientists from MIT, Technion, Johns Hopkins, Tel Aviv University, and UC Berkeley. It was founded by Zooko Wilcox (born Bryce Wilcox) who also founded the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, and created the Zerocoin protocol between 2013 and 2014. Zcash operates at the bleeding-edge of cryptography, requiring and producing novel research which is then freely shared with the rest of the ecosystem, including competitors. \n\n Released in October 2016, ZEC is similar to Bitcoin in that it has a fixed total supply of 21 million units and its mining reward is cut in half roughly every four years. Initially, 50 ZEC is created every ten minutes. Of the newly created ZEC 80% goes to the miners, and 20% to founders, employees, and investors - dubbed \u2018the founder's reward\u2019. It aims to discourage pump and dumps during the first few years of operation. For Zooko this represents an annual incentive of around $4.2M based on an exchange rate of $170/ZEC. \n\n After four years, the number of ZEC created every ten minutes will drop to 25, but 100% of it will go to the miners. The end result is that of the total ZEC, 10% (or 2.1 million) will have been distributed to the founders and early stakeholders. \n\n Developers have criticized the security of Zcash, in particular, the \u2018ceremony\u2019 which created the zk-SNARK public parameters; this involved six participants who created individual \u201cshards\u201d of the private/public key-pair and then burned them to DVDs. Participants followed a document called \u201cZcash Multi-party Computation Instructions\u201d to create the shards. \n\n The document provided technical requirements for the hardware used, as well as instructions for downloading the required software and burning the shards to DVDs. The participants then allegedly destroyed their shards of the private key and combined the shards of the public key to create the zk-SNARK public parameters. It is said that all the computers involved were subsequently destroyed to prevent anyone gaining keystroke information. \n\n Technologists argue that there is no proof that participants did not conspire to keep the public key, or that cameras, radio signals or satellites could have been used to retrieve keystroke information.",

    "description": "Horizen ZEN (previously known as ZenCash) is a digital cryptocurrency with a focus on privacy.  The decentralized blockchain platform Horizen is used for cryptocurrency transactions and communications with optional privacy.  The goal of the creators is not just to provide users with anonymous transactions but to create a secure environment where people can communicate, share information and perform different activities with the possibility to hide their traces.\n\nThe US-based Zen Blockchain foundation that controls Horizen was launched in May 2017 without ICO and pre-mine.  ZenCash launched its network at the end of the same year and it was the first end-to-end encrypted cryptocurrency network.  In August 2018, ZenCash was rebranded under the new name of Horizen.\nHorizen key features\nThe platform focuses on such principles as:\n\nAutonomy.  Using a decentralized model without a central authority, Horizen\u2019s DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is more resilient to the attacks from the outside than a traditional corporation.\nSustainable economics.  The team standing behind the project believes that a better world is achieved with the help of technology and economic activities resulting in a strong and sustainable ecosystem.\nResearch and development.  The team believes that it\u2019s essential to develop a wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.  \n\nHorizen is not the only blockchain project focusing on privacy, but it comes with the following features that help it stand out of other projects:\n\nThere is a possibility to select among pseudonymous addresses or entirely private transactions if necessary.  \nIt employs client to client and node-to-node communication thus giving better censorship resistance.\nThe users are fully protected using anonymous publishing via ZenPub.\nHorizen network\nHorizen is a scalable blockchain system with a new Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP).  It helps to develop an entirely decentralized sidechain ecosystem thus making the Horizon system a \u201cblockchain of blockchains\u201d.  Its protocol checks if consensus is executed correctly in compliance with the rules established by the developers of the sidechain.  The modular protocol enabled by the system architecture makes the consensus of sidechains fully decoupled from the core.  Modularization of this kind allows massive scalability.  The network doesn\u2019t depend upon single consensus, programming language or the same design detail in its sidechains.  \n\nThe foundation stone of the platform is \u201czero-knowledge\u201d cryptographic technology called zk-SNARKs that presents a new form of zero-knowledge cryptography (Zcash was the first project to implement it).  The platform features a strong privacy thanks to full encryption of shielded transactions with verification as valid under consensus rules of the network applying zk-SNARK proofs.\n\nAlso, the following protocols ensure anonymity and privacy: TLS integration, distributed publishing, domain fronting, client-to-node encryption, and end-to-end encryption.  The users take control of their privacy by selecting the level of transparency they wish.  The network includes the DAO, a private messenger ZenChat, a publishing platform ZenPub, and an endpoint masking similar to TOR ZenHide.\n\nThe Super-Nodes created by the team provide support to numerous applications such as ZenXchange, ZenGrid, etc.  A secure node system is used by Horizen to transmit data through the nodes using the core protocol with strict privacy requirements.  All messages in the ZenChat service are secure.  \nZEN token\nAs it has already been mentioned above, Horizen didn\u2019t have an ICO as ZenCash was forked from Zclassic (ZCL).  The holders of ZCL received ZEN at a 1:1 ratio.  The mining algorithm Equihash Proof-of-Work (PoW) was employed to get ZEN, but after a 51% attack in June 2018, the team started working on a new consensus algorithm to improve the security.  \n\nZEN is a privacy coin that comes with a full set of secure and private tools to help users stay protected.  It\u2019s traded on the open market of cryptocurrencies.  Among the official wallets are Sphere developed by Horizen, Arizen, Horizen Core, Zen Wallet, MyZenWallet and Swing Wallet.  It\u2019s also possible to store ZEN on the third-party wallets such as Coinomi, Ledger, CoolWallet.  \n\nWith the total supply of 21 million ZEN, the following distribution mechanism is used to allocate mining rewards and to raise funds for the development of the project: \n\n60% is allocated to miners\n20% is given to DAOs\n10% is allocated to Secure Node Operators\n10% is allocated to Super Node Operators\n\n\nHorizen team and partners\nThe co-founders of ZenCash are Ron Vigilione, a former physicist and mathematician who is presently a Ph.D. Candidate in Finance researching blockchain, and Rolf Versluis, an experienced business owner.  The team also includes software developers who work constantly over the network to release frequent updates.\n\nHorizen partners with a technology company IONK for faster improvement of scalability, security, and performance of the network.",

    "description": "Zilliqa is a scalable, secure, high-performance public blockchain platform designed for creating decentralized apps.  This is the first platform of this kind to implement the sharding technology which aims to resolve the scalability issue inherent to all the Ethereum and Bitcoin-based projects.  The platform is fueled by a native utility token Zilling (ZIL) that participants pay for processing transactions or running smart contracts.  It is available for trading on top exchange platforms including Kraken, Bitfinex, Binance, and Huobi.  The total supply of ZIL equals to 21 billion.  The ICO started at the end of December 2018 and raised its full cap of 22 million USD worth of ether in a matter of a few days in a private funding round.  One of the biggest investors was Danhua Capital, a famous Chinese venture capital firm.  The team decided to cancel its plans for public token sale after that.  But the community interest motivated them to allocate 4445 ETH worth of ZIL for a public sake which helped them double the raised amount - in a matter of a few days as well.  An interesting fact is that Zilliqa\u2019s team mostly comprises of computer specialists with the academic background.  The idea emerged as an R&D project developed by a group of enthusiasts from the National University of Singapore.  Before conducting an ICO, they had spent two years of hard work creating a functioning blockchain.  The project\u2019s CEO Xinshu Dong and Chief Scientific Advisor Prateek Saxena stepped aside from active roles at the project and joined the Board of Directors in May 2019.  The former Crypto Lead and a co-founder of the project, Amrit Kumar, took the position of President and Chief Scientific Officer after that.  The project was initially launched on the Ethereum platform with ERC-20 tokens because the public mainnet had not yet been released by that time while the team needed funds to make their plans a reality.  Zilliqa conducted a token swap in January 2019.  Token swap is a mechanism that helps token owners convert ERC20 ZILs from the Ethereum network to native ZILs on the Zilliqa network at the rate of 1:1.  The ZIL token can be stored on a number of wallets with the Moon Wallet as the top recommendation from the developing team.  It is blockchain agnostic and supports both Zilliqa and Ethereum chains.  ZIL tokens are available for mining using a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol.  It means that the regular PoW is used to establish identity only when you start mining and in the specified timed intervals.  The rest of the time the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and an Elliptic Curve Based Schnorr Signature Algorithm with a discordant abbreviation of EC-Schnorr will be utilized.  Zilliqa launched its mainnet on January 31st, 2018, claiming that the new blockchain would be 1,000 times as fast as Ethereum that is only capable of verifying 19 transactions per second at the maximum.  First transactions on the platform were enabled in Q1 2019 with the smart contracts following quite soon after that in Q2.  The release of smart contracts\u2019 functionality made it possible for developers to write and launch their own pieces of code.  Ethereum-based projects are based on the programming language named Solidity which has proved to be very complex and led to numerous mistakes in the dApps\u2019 code and money losses (take the ill-famous DAO hack, for example).  To address Ethereum\u2019s security issues and vulnerabilities, Zilliqa has invented its own language named Scilla.    Scilla-based smart contracts come with the following benefits: The new language comes with the built-in functionality that helps developers conduct regular checks to ensure that there are no bugs in the code and that it works just as planned. The built-in library of standard operations facilitating the developing progress. Different operational components such as communication with other contracts and computations are segregated in a pretty clear way.  This helps to protect dApps from hacking incidents similar to the one that happened with DAO.  It\u2019s worth saying a few words about the sharding technology as well.  This is a scaling solution that implies splitting a database (a blockchain) into parts or shards and spreading the load across multiple servers.  One of the key issues, that Bitcoin and Ethereum ran into in 2017 with the drastic surge of cryptocurrencies\u2019 popularity, was related to scalability.  These networks and all their derivatives are built in such a way that every transaction has to be confirmed by all the nodes running the network.  As the network grows, more verifications are needed which makes the system clumsy and inefficient.  The main idea behind the sharding technology is that each transaction does not necessarily have to be confirmed by all the nodes.  It\u2019s enough to get confirmation from a limited number of participants.  A transaction confirmed by, let\u2019s say, 100 participants (that make up a shard) will be just as secure as the one confirmed by 10,000.  Once a shard completes its job, the new transaction is linked to the main network.  This helps to verify transactions much faster and significantly reduces the network fees.  In theory, such an approach may help to verify a limitless number of transactions every second.  Although Zilliqa was the first one to implement it, it\u2019s no longer the only one in the industry.  While Ethereum is slowly moving towards its final stage Serenity, many other projects have emerged and the scalability race is getting harder to win with every day.",

    "description": "0x (ZRX) is an open protocol that provides infrastructure used to build decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain.  The 0x project utilizes off-chain transaction relayers and smart contracts to accomplish this.  Users of the protocol pay relayers with the native ZRX token.  In addition, the ZRX token is used for decentralized governance over the protocol\u2019s upgrade system.  ZRX token holders have a voice in how the protocol should be improved over time depending on how many tokens they own.\n\nZRX is an ERC-20 token and as such can be stored in any Ethereum wallet.\n\n0x aims to solve the inefficiencies of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.  Although decentralized exchanges are great at security, they lag behind centralized exchanges in user operational costs (higher gas fees) and accessibility (slow). \n\nThe 0x protocol makes decentralized exchanges better by employing off-chain ordering relays together with on-chain settlements.  This allows users to broadcast an order off-chain that another user can fill.  It is only after a value transfer is executed that it is written on-chain, leaving all other trading commands to off-chain procedures.  Transactions are only run on the network when a trade is performed, allowing users to decrease their gas fees when trading.\n\nThe 0x Core Team, co-founded by Will Warren (CEO) and Amir Bandeali (CTO) in October 2016, leads the 0x protocol project.  Before 0x, Warren conducted applied physics research at the Los Alamos National Laboratory while Bandeali worked as a fixed income trader with DRW.  The 0x Core Team is headquartered in San Francisco with members distributed throughout the world.\n\nThe team created 0x OTC, a web app that allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens directly on the Ethereum blockchain using the 0x protocol.  In addition, they\u2019ve created 0x.js, a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of building web apps on top of the 0x protocol. \n\nThe ICO was held on August 15th, 2017 and raised $24 million dollars.  There is a fixed supply of one billion ZRX of which 500 million (50%) were sold in the ICO.  The other 50% was released with 15% retained by the 0x team, 15% going to the developer fund, 10% going to the founding team, and 10% going to advisors and early backers.  The tokens set aside for founders, advisors, and team members are gradually released over the course of four years.  Tokens bought during the launch event were immediately liquid.\n\n0x is backed by the Fintech Blockchain Group, Pantera Capital, Polychain Capital, Jen Advisors, and Blockchain Capital.",
